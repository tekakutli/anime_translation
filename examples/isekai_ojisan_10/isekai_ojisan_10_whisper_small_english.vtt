00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Spring

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is the man who's suspicious.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I have to protect fuji!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, Takahawk, Takahawk...

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Damn, you're so mean.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hello!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Did you come to play with me?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
No, no, no!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What are you doing?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
-I'm going to help you! -Takagumi!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You're so nice.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's go to the room.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I've got a really good pair of glasses.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm taking a video and playing with them online.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Oh, a cute pair of glasses.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But I don't have enough glasses.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I know, right? I'm going to push them.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I want them!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Spring

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
(I'm not a bad girl)

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.600
Excuse me!

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
Oh, welcome!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.600
Huh?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.100
Why are you here, Sama?

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.600
Run!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.100
I'll do something, so run away!

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.300
What are you saying?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.600
They're...

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.300
...they're trying to mess up women!

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.900
I've never seen anyone like that in the lady's room!

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.100
You're calling me a bad girl, Asawa.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.800
You're not here?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.600
I'm on my way out.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600
Huh?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600
(I'm not a bad girl)

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.600
A fish?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.100
You're a bad girl.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.200
You're a bad girl.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200
You're a normal girl, Kyuri.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.500
Hey, you're not going to come back, right?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.400
I'm fine.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.200
I just got a cold.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200
I'll tell you in the Holy Spirit's body.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.500
What?

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.900
Rei?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.800
If you know my secret, you'll be a Echelon.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.000
I know!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.500
If you're a Echelon, you'll have the worst effect on your personality!

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.600
Huh?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600
Asawa!

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.600
I'm sure I'm going to be in trouble!

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.500
W-W-W-W-W-W-

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.100
O-Ojisan!

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.800
Huh?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:07.800
Huh?

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.900
I-I'm sorry to the dead, but please don't get involved in my business!

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.900
Dead?

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.000
O-Ojisan, did you see it on the Internet?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.700
It's just a lie.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.400
It's safe.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.000
Seiga isn't like that at all.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.400
The same way I talked to Miss Misako when I was in the Maltese.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.900
A YouTuber?

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.900
(The video of the old man is...)

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.500
What? I'm a bit nervous.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.200
What's that?

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.300
The old man from Takafumi is different, but he's a good guy.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.000
But why is Fujimi here?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.300
That's...

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.000
O-Ojip-pe-po!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.300
Ojisan!

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.500
This is definitely a good idea!

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.000
You can use it!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.800
Oh, the old man is really good.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.000
But if the 35-year-old man does it...

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.100
I see.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.900
Fujimi!

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.500
I want to drink coffee.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.900
I'll put it in.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.600
I knew it was Takafumi's wish.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.700
I'll have to check it out.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.700
Takafumi!

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.000
Hey, do you want to see the photo of Fujimi and her trip?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.200
Y-Yes, I got it right.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.100
It's close!

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.500
Sit down! Sit down for a second!

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.700
(The old man from Takafumi is...)

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.700
How is it?

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.300
If you're just looking at your chest, you're gonna be a piece of shit.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.100
I-I can't eat this old man's finger!

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.000
Huh?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.200
Who's this guy?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.500
I don't know.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.700
Mr. Ding?

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.500
Oh, what's that?

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.100
Then, what about this photo?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.300
(The old man from Takafumi is...)

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.300
What? Why me?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.800
Who's this guy?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.300
What? I've found it!

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.700
Hmm...

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.600
Takafumi, you're from elementary school?

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.300
What was Fujimi like in the past?

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.600
She was a bit cooler.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.100
Well, I guess she's not that different.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.100
Hmm...

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.100
She might have been like Chiaki just now.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.900
Oh, that cute little brother.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.100
He's been doing this for about two years.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.100
I'm over there.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.100
Huh?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.400
(The old man from Takafumi is...)

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.400
Well, let's take a video of the "Ciaki" sister.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.700
It's okay. It's okay.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.100
I won't let her get on the internet.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.500
(The old man from Takafumi is...)

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500
Are you taking it?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.500
Yeah.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.500
What are you doing, Sumi?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.500
What?

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:02.700
(The old man from Takafumi is...)

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.700
What are you doing, Fujimi?

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:12.700
I'm not interested in girls.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.700
That's my picture!

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.700
Hmm...

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.700
(The old man from Takafumi is...)

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.700
(The old man from Takafumi is...)

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.700
Takafumi?

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.700
You were talking about Fujimiya's childhood.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.700
Are you from the high school?

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.700
Yes.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.700
I'm from Ikyurasu, Elran.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.700
I'm from the elementary school.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.700
What? This is...

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.700
What? What?

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.700
I dropped it! I dropped it!

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.700
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700
Ah...

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.460
The spirit of memory is erased from the

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.700
the body of the adventurer.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.700
Run, Yaki! Run!

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.700
What's wrong with you?

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.700
What's wrong with you?

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.700
Are you in Sony?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.700
Sony didn't make anything like that.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.700
It's okay. I'll go to sleep.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.700
Uncle...

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.700
Please don't erase your memory.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.700
I'm sorry.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.700
Even in the world of ruins,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.700
I was scolded for not erasing my memory.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.700
What happened?

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.700
That was a hot spring.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.700
A hot spring?

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.700
The old man went to Elf after he returned from Mayenryu.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.700
Yes.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.700
What does the hot spring of this world look like?

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.700
Is it a little bit of a service?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.700
Let me ask you.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.700
Well...

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.700
It doesn't seem to be a mess.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.700
The spirit of memory is the best for the viewer

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.700
to have a mirror angle.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.700
The bath is especially effective in privacy.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.700
Such a high-quality word.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.700
You're so good at listening.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.700
Ikulas Elron.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Elf.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Elf is a female, so she doesn't have any pictures.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It's been a long time.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It's been a month since I took a bath, so it must have been a long time.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
-Is there 20 minutes left? -Let's hurry.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Oh, 20 minutes.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
-Did you get it? -Why?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
- You're back? - Why?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Huh? Why?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
- I'm back! - I'm back!

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
- I'm back! - You can't do anything! Hurry!

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
What was that?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
The "Goroy" is a magic spell that can attack.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Oh, it's the magic of the Elf.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
The Elf?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
What? You can change the attitude now.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000
What I like about Garhoy's Varga is that the motion of Graviton Thunder and Zero Drive
Illusion is super cool.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It's not because it's the Elf.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You're the Elf, right?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It's a long way from that.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
It's a long way from that.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I'm here.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Japanese?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Why are you traveling?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Do you understand Japanese Bahamaru?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
As Mabel said, he's really a angel.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Japanese Bahamaru?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
The reason I made this trip was because of the angel from Japan Bahamaru 20 years ago.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
What?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
There's an angel besides the angel and Mabel?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Is he here?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
He was in Gran Bahamaru, Shoujiro Murayama, about 20 years ago.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Murayama?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
He was 88 years old last year.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I see.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The Yuka of the Hell.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
He really reads it.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
What does the Hell mean?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It means that he's the world that he used to go to before he died.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
That means he recognized this world.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
You're a good old man.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Yeah, that's great.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The 90s were so many times that the Yuka of Hell was remembered as the Yuka of the Hell.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The Yuka of Hell?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Excuse me.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I'm Gran Tsutomu, the head of the Shihainin Sword Sect in Lengoku.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:13.520
You seem to be very familiar with the

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.520
The angel is very popular in the country.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.520
But it's a rumor that he was able to make this trip without a single person passing by.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.520
Oh.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:04.520
It's true.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.000
I've seen the rumor that he brought the trip from Japan Bahamaru.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
That's not true.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
The person who brought it disappeared when the Yuka of Hell died.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
When the Shihainin Sword Sect was taken, the Yuka of Hell disappeared in front of his feet.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Oh, the truth!

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
That's a good record of the Shihainin Sword Sect.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The angel from the Hell is said to be able to give one power to the God.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000
The angel is able to control the material of the living and the living.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The angel is...

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Is it because of the item?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I'm talking about something very important.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
In the action game, there are some parts that can't skip and some parts that can't be
skipped.
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It's because of the fact that something else is being cut in between.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
That's the story of the game, isn't it?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
An event that's so important to know the mystery of the heaven.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Okugan, let's go.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Are the three of us on the hot spring?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
We're on our way to work, Mr. Nukaria.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I wonder if Mr. Murayama was also this kind of person.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
By the way, Mr. Oji, you're a bit of a rambunctious person in the world, aren't you?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Oh, I know.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Even though he's a young angel, he's a bit of a rambunctious person.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The spirit is recognized as a human being.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It's amazing.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
If you say it's a temporary, it's sold for three times.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Well then, Mr. Yadodai, please give us a 40,000 yen discount.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
40,000 yen? I'm not being fooled!

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
If it's a Japanese dollar, it's about 40,000 yen.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
There's also a science department.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
What?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So, the price of the time when Mr. Murayama was sold...

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
It's 30,000 yen, isn't it?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
1000 yen!

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It's not a dollar.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And here it is.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
It's nice to take a bath and feel good.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Send it to me early.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
You've cut it very nicely, Yukata.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Right?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The way you wore it was on the train of the knight 400 years ago.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Oh, you brought this book well.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
It's called "The Knight", right?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
But it's a bit of a mess.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Oh, there it is.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I see. Then, where's my room?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Here, here.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Aibaeya.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Why?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It seems that only the other party is here.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Really?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Really?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
But, besides us...

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It seems that it's a bit of a mess to not meet other guests.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I don't like to be an Aibaeya, but it's okay.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I don't like it, after all.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
There's only one other guest today, so...

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I'll go to another room.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Now!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Let's go in.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Children...

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Don't worry about the wedding, Tsundere-san.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
It's a room with a roof over it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
That's right!

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
It's a tatami!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
This is a tatami, right?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
It smells unique.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Are you nostalgic?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
No.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
My room was in the flooring bed, so that's all.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Then...

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
What's this space?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
What is this space?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
It's a mysterious space!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
The bedroom is...

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I'll sleep here. You can use everything.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
See you.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
What?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I searched for it for a month, but it's so much.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Are you tired?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Wait!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I'm sure there's a muscle on your legs.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I was looking for you!

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
What's that?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
It's a massage for the bath.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I'm grateful to you.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
If you didn't have a warm heart,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I might not have been able to return to you.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
It hurts!

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
It hurts!

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
What?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
It hurts!

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Don't run away!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The scar on your spine is a proof that you're in pain!

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
It's my fault, so I have to get rid of it!

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Ready, set...

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
It feels so good!

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I want to get rid of it!

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I'm sorry!

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
No!

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000
You, please stop.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
The courtyard?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
What?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Stop!

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Are you okay? Are you okay?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
It's not bad!

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
It's not bad.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
But...

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Can you hear me?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
The great spirit of memory.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
There's only a spirit here.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
It's fine with the correct standard.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
The morning bell is ringing.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Please take care of it.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Fujimia...

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I'll play it.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
The night is coming.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
(Song)

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Rengsord Stagger!

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Stagger Magna!

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
What are you guys doing?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Alicia...

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Alicia is the one who's fighting.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Wait, wait!

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I told you I was interested, right?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
One hero?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Then let's go.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Are the other members of the White House of the One-Six?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Kuroki, I'm sorry.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Kuroki...

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I'm sorry!

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I'm wondering what the relationship between the two of us is.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
What kind of relationship do you think it is?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
That's...

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Go, go, go, go.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
You can't see it. Don't worry.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
-I'm sorry. -Thank goodness.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Hero?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
What's that?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Look, it's a gift from Harinezumi.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
I see.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
-Do you need it? -No.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
-It's okay. -It's not okay.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
It's good to trust others, but...

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
-I'll always be... -You're the ones I trust.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
It's not a stranger.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
It's so cool!

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Shut up, Madness!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
What? Then what about the two of you?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Hero, I'll tell you the details.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
This finger is the one that was put on that big face.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
It's broken!

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
It's broken in a very important way!

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
You didn't get the finger, did you, Hero?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
What? I didn't get it!

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I don't have a gun.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
The two of you...

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Have you been dating Hero for a long time?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Well...

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So, which one is going to get the love of Hero?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Hero?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
I guess this is a good choice.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Wait, what?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
What?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
It's impossible.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I have a choice for this one, too.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I knew it, but you're so good!

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Is your childhood friend that weak?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
So, what are you guys doing in the mountains?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I'm going to work.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
I've passed the real power of the dark palace.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
The dark palace?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Thank you very much.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
The ultimate wonder?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
But the power of the dark palace should be black like the darkness.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I painted it! It's cute!

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
It's a huge tool.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
The magic is lost.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
There's no such a place to hide.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I want you to understand the importance of things.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
What are you doing?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
You're making a deal, aren't you?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
You two will fight with the power of the Holy Spirit and God, right?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
We, the warriors, will use our physical abilities to make a deal.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
A special skill?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I want to see it.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
I'm not sure.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Something's up there!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
What's the story?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Ikyu-las Elran.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
The dark palace magic is out.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Wow, something's coming out!

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
It's a revolution!

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
What are you looking at?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
This sire!

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Yeah, he was thrown away, so he used it to keep the laundry.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
I guess it's just a sword's sire.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
This is it!

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Where is that place?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
The top of the north mountain.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Are you going from there?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
It's pretty far.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
It's a hero.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Don't let him get away.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Why did Elf come here so suddenly?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
I found a huge magic tool.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
A huge magic tool?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
It's the power of the initials.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Elf is important to the ancient culture, so he's collecting it.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Hey, Kuroki. Elf is all alone.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Elf is fine.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Is this place safe from monsters?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
The master of the castle is a god, so he can build it.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
As long as he can't get in, it's...

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
It's a bit of a shock.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
The castle is a bit of a shock.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
The castle is a bit of a shock.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Thank you for watching!
