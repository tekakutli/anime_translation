00:03.070 --> 00:08.570
This is where that suspicious man lives...

00:08.570 --> 00:11.070
I have to protect Fujimi!

00:11.070 --> 00:15.070
Um... Takaoka Takaoka...

00:15.070 --> 00:18.070
Hello!

00:18.910 --> 00:25.030
You came to play too?

00:25.030 --> 00:27.070
No, no...

00:27.070 --> 00:28.750
What are you doing?

00:28.750 --> 00:32.510
- Um, I'm here to help... - Brother Takafumi!

00:30.070 --> 00:32.070
Hey, you're here.

00:32.070 --> 00:33.070
Huh?

00:34.070 --> 00:35.070
Hey, nice to see you.

00:35.070 --> 00:39.070
Then, let's go to your room.

00:39.070 --> 00:42.070
You had a really good dream the other day.

00:43.070 --> 00:46.070
I caught a really nice girl the other day.

00:46.070 --> 00:49.070
I took a video and uploaded it to the internet.

00:49.170 --> 00:51.430
Oh, a cute girl?

00:51.070 --> 00:53.070
But isn't that already enough?

00:53.070 --> 00:55.070
Right?

00:55.070 --> 00:57.070
I think it's about time I go to bed.

00:57.070 --> 01:02.070
Fujimi...

02:42.570 --> 02:45.730
Excuse me!

02:45.730 --> 02:47.950
Oh, welcome!

02:47.950 --> 02:50.150
Huh? Why is Sawa here?

02:50.150 --> 02:54.030
Run! I'll take care of this, so you run!

02:54.030 --> 02:55.410
What are you talking about?

02:55.410 --> 02:59.330
These guys are scumbags who call women "women"!

02:59.330 --> 03:01.970
I've only seen people like that in the comic books!

03:01.970 --> 03:04.290
Sawa, you're reading something awful.

03:04.290 --> 03:06.010
Is Mr. Oshi home?

03:06.010 --> 03:07.510
He's out for a bit.

03:07.510 --> 03:08.850
Huh?

03:11.870 --> 03:13.550
Fish?

03:13.550 --> 03:16.710
It's a gift from my grandmother.

03:16.710 --> 03:20.310
Normally, it's eggplant or cucumber.

03:20.310 --> 03:23.510
Hey, I hope he doesn't fly back.

03:23.510 --> 03:26.190
Don't worry. I just raised a flag.

03:26.190 --> 03:28.270
It's a spirit sign.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.990
A flag? A spirit?

03:30.990 --> 03:33.870
If anyone finds out about his secret, it'll be a yukurasukiora.

03:33.870 --> 03:37.990
I know! If he gets yukurasukiora, it'll affect his personality!

03:40.970 --> 03:42.930
I'm running away, Fushimi!

03:42.930 --> 03:43.930
Huh?

03:43.930 --> 03:45.730
Sawa?

03:45.730 --> 03:47.850
The cult is definitely in danger!

03:47.850 --> 03:49.850
W-W-Wait!

03:49.850 --> 03:54.490
Hey, mister!

03:54.490 --> 03:58.110
Huh?

04:07.210 --> 04:08.210
Huh?

04:08.210 --> 04:17.470
I-I'm sorry, but don't involve Mr. Fushimiya!

04:17.470 --> 04:19.190
A believer?

04:19.190 --> 04:21.630
You're exaggerating.

04:21.630 --> 04:23.190
Did you see it on the internet?

04:23.190 --> 04:24.770
It's all lies.

04:24.770 --> 04:26.690
It's safe.

04:26.690 --> 04:29.150
That's not how SEGA works.

04:29.150 --> 04:31.530
Geez!

04:31.530 --> 04:35.870
It's the same way you talk when you're into the multi-player games.

04:36.650 --> 04:37.970
YouTuber?

04:37.970 --> 04:41.570
I see. I thought you were a cult.

04:41.570 --> 04:43.250
What's that?

04:43.250 --> 04:46.330
Mr. Takafumi is strange, but he's a good person.

04:46.330 --> 04:49.090
But why is Fushimi here?

04:49.090 --> 04:50.330
Well, that's...

04:50.330 --> 04:51.970
Hey, Chippu-peppa!

04:51.970 --> 04:53.290
It's an old man!

04:53.290 --> 04:55.890
It's definitely popular. You can use it.

04:55.890 --> 04:58.810
Oh, old man-jou is a great word.

04:58.810 --> 05:01.650
But if a 35-year-old man does it...

05:01.650 --> 05:05.170
I see.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.970
-Fushimi. -Huh?

05:06.970 --> 05:09.510
I want some coffee.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.170
I'll go get it.

05:11.170 --> 05:14.650
He's after Mr. Takafumi.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.770
Then I have to check.

05:16.770 --> 05:18.770
-Takafumi. -Huh?

05:18.770 --> 05:22.070
Hey, wanna see a picture of me and Fushimi on a trip?

05:22.070 --> 05:26.290
Okay, I got it.

05:26.290 --> 05:28.370
Hey, it's close!

05:28.370 --> 05:30.530
Let's sit down. Let's sit down for now.

05:30.530 --> 05:36.690
(Fushimi)

05:36.690 --> 05:37.690
What do you think?

05:37.690 --> 05:41.210
If you're just staring at my chest, I'm a loser.

05:41.210 --> 05:46.490
He's not eating my fingers!

05:46.490 --> 05:49.210
Who's this guy?

05:49.210 --> 05:51.570
I don't know.

05:51.570 --> 05:52.730
A clerk?

05:52.730 --> 05:55.370
Oh, I see.

05:55.370 --> 05:57.810
Then what about this picture?

05:58.810 --> 06:02.250
(Fushimi)

06:02.250 --> 06:04.490
Why me?

06:04.490 --> 06:05.730
Who's this guy?

06:05.730 --> 06:08.130
What's that? You found me!

06:08.130 --> 06:09.610
Hmm...

06:09.610 --> 06:12.530
Takafumi, you were in elementary school?

06:12.530 --> 06:15.170
What was Fushimi like in the past?

06:15.170 --> 06:17.490
He was a bit cooler.

06:17.490 --> 06:19.930
Well, he hasn't changed much.

06:19.930 --> 06:21.890
I see.

06:21.890 --> 06:24.890
He might've been like the current Chiaki.

06:24.890 --> 06:27.650
Oh, that cute little brother?

06:27.650 --> 06:30.090
We haven't seen each other for two years.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.090
He's over there.

06:31.090 --> 06:38.290
Then I'll take a video to commemorate you.

06:38.290 --> 06:42.010
It's okay. I won't upload it online.

06:42.010 --> 06:46.410
You're already taking it?

06:46.410 --> 06:47.410
Yeah.

06:47.410 --> 06:53.330
What are you doing, Sumi?

06:53.330 --> 06:54.330
What?

06:54.330 --> 06:56.330
(Fushimi)

06:56.330 --> 07:06.330
What are you doing, Fushimi?

07:07.530 --> 07:09.010
I know.

07:09.010 --> 07:12.410
I'm not that uninterested in women.

07:12.410 --> 07:15.890
That's my picture!

07:23.330 --> 07:24.810
Takami?

07:24.810 --> 07:29.610
You were talking about Fushimi when you were a kid.

07:29.610 --> 07:31.170
Are you in high school?

07:31.170 --> 07:32.730
Y-Yes.

07:32.730 --> 07:34.370
Ikyurasu Erran.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.730
Fushimi from elementary school was...

07:36.730 --> 07:38.610
Huh? This is...

07:38.610 --> 07:40.610
What's going on?

07:40.610 --> 07:41.690
It fell!

07:41.690 --> 07:43.770
Stop! Stop!

07:43.770 --> 07:44.770
Oh.

07:44.770 --> 07:50.970
Spirit of memory,

07:50.970 --> 07:53.370
erase the past from the blind man's body.

07:53.370 --> 07:54.770
Chiaki, run!

07:54.770 --> 07:55.770
Huh?

07:55.770 --> 07:59.290
Sumi, what was that?

07:59.290 --> 08:01.250
Huh? In Sonny's room?

08:01.250 --> 08:03.290
Sonny didn't make that.

08:03.290 --> 08:05.050
I'm going to go to bed.

08:05.050 --> 08:10.570
Mister...

08:10.570 --> 08:13.570
Please don't try to erase your memory.

08:13.570 --> 08:14.850
Sorry.

08:14.850 --> 08:17.170
I remember being scolded for trying to erase my memory

08:17.170 --> 08:20.370
in the other world.

08:20.370 --> 08:22.170
Huh? When?

08:22.170 --> 08:23.130
That was...

08:23.130 --> 08:24.770
Oh, right. At the hot spring.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.010
The hot spring...

08:27.010 --> 08:30.730
The one you went to with Elph after you returned from the Demon Dragon?

08:30.730 --> 08:31.450
Yeah.

08:31.450 --> 08:34.930
What? What's the hot spring like in the other world?

08:34.930 --> 08:38.010
Like, a service-related one?

08:38.010 --> 08:39.410
I'll ask.

08:39.410 --> 08:40.690
Let's see...

08:40.690 --> 08:43.290
It doesn't seem to be there.

08:47.050 --> 08:52.290
The spirit of memory optimizes the camera angle to suit the viewer.

08:52.290 --> 08:55.530
It seems that baths are especially considered for privacy.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.370
That's so advanced...

08:57.370 --> 08:59.290
He's really a good listener.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.890
Ikyuras Elrond.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.730
Huh?

09:03.730 --> 09:13.730
Elph?

09:25.770 --> 09:28.570
Elphs are female, so there's no footage.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.250
That's a long bath.

09:31.250 --> 09:34.570
It's been a month, so it should be long.

09:34.570 --> 09:35.970
About 20 minutes left?

09:35.970 --> 09:37.210
Hurry up!

09:37.210 --> 09:39.290
Oh, 20 minutes...

09:39.290 --> 09:41.650
The yukata?

09:41.650 --> 09:42.490
Why?

09:42.490 --> 09:44.370
Huh? Why?

09:44.370 --> 09:46.570
Well, it's not a rewind...

09:46.570 --> 09:47.450
A rewind!

09:47.450 --> 09:49.050
Either way is fine, so hurry up!

09:49.050 --> 09:54.170
What was that?

09:54.170 --> 09:55.130
The armor's removal is a great use of the magic of the magic of the

09:56.130 --> 10:01.410
Elgar royal family.

10:01.410 --> 10:02.130
Royal family, huh?

10:02.130 --> 10:04.450
Yeah. You're changing your attitude now?

10:04.450 --> 10:12.410
I like Garfie's Varga because the motion of Graviton Thunder and Zero Drive Illusion is
super
cool.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.370
Not because I'm a royal family.

10:14.370 --> 10:16.010
You're you.

10:16.010 --> 10:20.210
Yeah.

10:20.210 --> 10:23.690
The hot spring's far away.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.010
We're almost there.

10:26.010 --> 10:27.010
We're here.

10:27.010 --> 10:28.010
This is it.

10:28.010 --> 10:32.010
Japanese?

10:32.010 --> 10:33.010
A inn?

10:33.010 --> 10:34.010
Why?

10:34.010 --> 10:36.530
You know the Japanese Bahamaru language?

10:36.530 --> 10:39.690
As Mabel said, it's really an transfer.

10:39.690 --> 10:42.010
Japanese Bahamaru...

10:42.010 --> 10:47.490
The person who built this inn was a transfer from 20 years ago's Japanese Bahamaru.

10:47.490 --> 10:48.490
What?!

10:51.490 --> 10:55.490
There's a transfer from the ancestors of Uncle and Mabel?

10:55.490 --> 10:57.490
Is he here?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.490
Here?

10:58.490 --> 11:02.490
He...

11:02.490 --> 11:08.490
The person who was in Grand Bahamaru 20 years ago, just 10 days ago.

11:08.490 --> 11:09.490
Murayama?

11:09.490 --> 11:11.490
He's 88 years old this year.

11:11.490 --> 11:13.490
I see.

11:17.490 --> 11:22.490
"The Water of Purgatory"

11:22.490 --> 11:24.490
You can really read it.

11:24.490 --> 11:26.490
What does purgatory mean?

11:26.490 --> 11:32.490
To put it simply, it's a world where you purify yourself before you go to that world after
you
die.

11:32.490 --> 11:36.490
In other words, he recognized this world as such.

11:36.490 --> 11:38.490
You knew about it, Grandpa!

11:38.490 --> 11:39.490
Yeah, it's amazing!

11:39.490 --> 11:45.490
Yeah, the 90s were full of difficult words.

11:45.490 --> 11:49.490
I learned purgatory from the "The Evil King's Prologue to Purgatory."

11:49.490 --> 11:52.490
"The Evil King's Prologue to Purgatory"?

11:52.490 --> 11:55.490
Hello, there.

11:55.490 --> 11:59.490
I'm Grandstone, the leader of the purgatory.

11:59.490 --> 12:03.490
You seem to know a lot about Sendai.

12:03.490 --> 12:07.490
Yeah, the transfer story is popular in the country, but...

12:07.490 --> 12:12.490
It's a real shame that only one person, Shojiro, built this inn.

12:12.490 --> 12:13.490
Oh...

12:13.490 --> 12:17.490
I've heard rumors that he brought inn from Japan Bahamaru.

12:17.490 --> 12:19.490
That's not true.

12:19.490 --> 12:23.490
If a person from another world dies, the person who brought it will disappear.

12:23.490 --> 12:28.490
When Sendai took his breath, his clothes and body disappeared right before his eyes.

12:28.490 --> 12:30.490
Oh, the new truth!

12:30.490 --> 12:34.490
It's the same as the record of the knights of the Toshin-ken.

12:34.490 --> 12:40.490
It is said that the transfer from another world can be given one power from God.

12:40.490 --> 12:44.490
That is, the ability to freely operate material from living things.

12:44.490 --> 12:48.490
And he used the power of the knights to build this inn.

12:48.490 --> 12:51.490
Old man, you're organizing items?

12:51.490 --> 12:54.490
You're talking about something really important.

12:54.490 --> 12:59.490
In action games, there are times when you can't skip a long demo part.

12:59.490 --> 13:03.490
In the meantime, doing something else is engraved in your body.

13:03.490 --> 13:04.490
That's why.

13:04.490 --> 13:06.490
That's the story of the game.

13:06.490 --> 13:09.490
An important event to know the mystery of the world.

13:09.490 --> 13:11.490
Oak Gaon, let's go.

13:11.490 --> 13:21.490
Are the three of you doing the hot springs alone?

13:24.490 --> 13:27.490
We're doing it for work, Ms. Nukariya.

13:27.490 --> 13:30.490
I wonder if Mr. Murayama treated her like this.

13:30.490 --> 13:36.490
By the way, old man, you're a bit rough with older people in another world, right?

13:36.490 --> 13:41.490
Oh, that's true. I'm also polite to young shopkeepers.

13:41.490 --> 13:45.490
The legend is that it was recognized as a person.

13:45.490 --> 13:47.490
I have a great feeling.

13:47.490 --> 13:50.490
If you say it in a low posture, it was sold for three.

13:50.490 --> 13:54.490
Then the inn will be 400,000 pieces for two people.

13:54.490 --> 13:56.490
400,000 pieces? It's not stolen!

13:56.490 --> 13:59.490
It's about 40,000 yen for a Japanese-yen coin.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.490
There are also high-priced coins.

14:01.490 --> 14:03.490
Oh, what?

14:03.490 --> 14:07.490
Then the value of the coin when the old man was sold...

14:07.490 --> 14:09.490
It's 30,000 yen.

14:09.490 --> 14:10.490
1,000 yen?

14:10.490 --> 14:12.490
It wasn't even a yen.

14:12.490 --> 14:14.490
So here it is.

14:14.490 --> 14:17.490
It felt good to take a bath.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.490
Send it soon.

14:18.490 --> 14:24.490
You're dressed nicely, Yukata.

14:24.490 --> 14:28.490
Right?

14:29.490 --> 14:33.490
The knight's flag 400 years ago had a kikata on it.

14:33.490 --> 14:36.490
Oh, you had a good book.

14:36.490 --> 14:38.490
It's called kimono, right?

14:38.490 --> 14:41.490
But it's a little plain.

14:41.490 --> 14:45.490
Oh, there.

14:45.490 --> 14:48.490
I see. Then my room is...

14:48.490 --> 14:51.490
Here, here. The room next door.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.490
Why?

14:52.490 --> 14:56.490
It's... it's only open here.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.490
Really?

14:58.490 --> 15:00.490
But it's not for us.

15:00.490 --> 15:05.490
It's a trick to keep it away from other guests.

15:05.490 --> 15:08.490
I don't like ideas, but I can't help it.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.490
You don't like it, do you?

15:10.490 --> 15:16.490
There's only one group of guests today, so I'll prepare another room.

15:16.490 --> 15:22.490
Come on.

15:22.490 --> 15:24.490
Let's go in.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.490
The children...

15:26.490 --> 15:29.490
You're not bothered by the noise anymore, Tsundere-san.

15:29.490 --> 15:34.490
The futon is on the floor.

15:34.490 --> 15:35.490
It's soya.

15:35.490 --> 15:38.490
Tatami.

15:38.490 --> 15:40.490
This is tatami, right?

15:40.490 --> 15:41.490
It smells unique.

15:41.490 --> 15:42.490
Do you miss it?

15:42.490 --> 15:47.490
No. My room had a floor and a bed, so not that much.

15:47.490 --> 15:49.490
Bye.

15:49.490 --> 15:55.490
What's with this space?

15:55.490 --> 15:58.490
What is this space?

15:58.490 --> 16:00.490
It's a mystery space!

16:00.490 --> 16:02.490
I can't believe you're in the same room.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.490
I'll sleep here, so you can use it all.

16:05.490 --> 16:06.490
Bye.

16:06.490 --> 16:11.490
What?

16:11.490 --> 16:13.490
I've been looking for him for a month.

16:13.490 --> 16:14.490
What a fool.

16:14.490 --> 16:22.490
Are you tired?

16:24.490 --> 16:25.490
Hey!

16:25.490 --> 16:28.490
Your legs are really tense.

16:28.490 --> 16:31.490
I was looking for you. What's that?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.490
It seems it'll help you massage after a bath.

16:33.490 --> 16:43.490
I'm grateful to you.

16:43.490 --> 16:48.490
If it weren't for your warm heart, I might not have been able to return from the dragon.

16:51.490 --> 16:54.490
Ouch!

16:54.490 --> 16:56.490
What?

16:56.490 --> 16:59.490
Ouch!

16:59.490 --> 17:09.490
Don't run away.

17:09.490 --> 17:12.490
The pot hurts because you're tired.

17:12.490 --> 17:19.490
It's my fault, so you have to loosen it.

17:19.490 --> 17:21.490
Ready...

17:21.490 --> 17:27.490
It feels good! It feels good!

17:27.490 --> 17:29.490
That's enough!

17:29.490 --> 17:30.490
You idiot!

17:30.490 --> 17:33.490
What are you doing?

17:33.490 --> 17:35.490
I'm the one who's going to...

17:35.490 --> 17:37.490
This is bad!

17:37.490 --> 17:39.490
I'm scared!

17:39.490 --> 17:47.490
It's heavy. Hold me.

17:47.490 --> 17:48.490
What?

17:48.490 --> 17:52.490
A big face?

17:52.490 --> 17:54.490
What?

17:54.490 --> 17:59.490
Stop!

17:59.490 --> 18:02.490
Are you okay with going forward?

18:02.490 --> 18:03.490
Isn't this bad?

18:03.490 --> 18:04.490
There's nothing bad about it.

18:04.490 --> 18:05.490
But...

18:05.490 --> 18:06.490
Can you hear me?

18:06.490 --> 18:08.490
The great spirit of memories.

18:08.490 --> 18:10.490
Only the sage is here.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.490
The correction criteria is "It's okay to be rough."

18:12.490 --> 18:14.490
"You can run away in the morning."

18:14.490 --> 18:15.490
I'm counting on you.

18:15.490 --> 18:17.490
Fujimiya...

18:17.490 --> 18:18.490
I'm going to revive you.

18:18.490 --> 18:27.490
Regsurd Stagga.

18:27.490 --> 18:33.490
Stagga Magnum.

18:33.490 --> 18:38.490
What are you guys doing?

18:38.490 --> 18:40.490
Alicia...

18:40.490 --> 18:42.490
Alicia is going to go first and take a peek.

18:42.490 --> 18:46.490
Wait! I just said I was curious.

18:46.490 --> 18:47.490
A hero's first move?

18:47.490 --> 18:50.490
The other group of guests were Alicia and the others?

18:50.490 --> 18:53.490
Kuroki, I'm sorry.

18:53.490 --> 18:56.490
Kuroki, huh?

18:56.490 --> 18:59.490
I'm sorry!

18:59.490 --> 19:03.490
I was wondering what kind of relationship you two have.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.490
What kind of relationship do you think we have?

19:05.490 --> 19:07.490
That's...

19:07.490 --> 19:09.490
Let me see.

19:11.490 --> 19:13.490
Oh, I see.

19:13.490 --> 19:15.490
I'm in trouble.

19:15.490 --> 19:16.490
So easy.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.490
I'm glad. So easy.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.490
A hero?

19:20.490 --> 19:21.490
You?

19:21.490 --> 19:26.490
Here. This is for defeating hedgehogs.

19:26.490 --> 19:28.490
I see.

19:28.490 --> 19:29.490
Check if it's enough.

19:29.490 --> 19:30.490
No.

19:30.490 --> 19:32.490
I don't like it!

19:32.490 --> 19:36.490
It's okay to trust others like that.

19:36.490 --> 19:38.490
But that sweetness will someday...

19:38.490 --> 19:41.490
You're the ones I trusted.

19:41.490 --> 19:45.490
Not others.

19:45.490 --> 19:52.490
That's so cool!

19:52.490 --> 19:54.490
Shut up, Madness Berserker.

19:54.490 --> 19:56.490
Then you two are...

19:56.490 --> 20:01.490
Hero, I won't tell you the details,

20:01.490 --> 20:05.490
but this ring is a gift from that orc face.

20:07.490 --> 20:08.490
She took it off!

20:08.490 --> 20:10.490
She took off the most important part intentionally!

20:10.490 --> 20:14.490
You didn't get the ring from him, did you?

20:14.490 --> 20:15.490
What?

20:15.490 --> 20:18.490
I-I wouldn't get it!

20:18.490 --> 20:22.490
I'm not that considerate.

20:22.490 --> 20:24.490
You two.

20:24.490 --> 20:28.490
Have you been dating the hero for long?

20:28.490 --> 20:31.490
Yeah, kind of.

20:31.490 --> 20:35.490
So, who do you think will win the hero's heart?

20:35.490 --> 20:36.490
Elf?

20:36.490 --> 20:39.490
I guess you have to decide by a duel.

20:39.490 --> 20:40.490
Wait.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.490
What?

20:43.490 --> 20:46.490
No.

20:46.490 --> 20:48.490
I have the right to choose.

20:48.490 --> 20:50.490
I knew it, but you're so mean!

20:50.490 --> 20:54.490
Are childhood friends that weak?

20:54.490 --> 20:58.490
So, what are you two doing in the mountains?

20:58.490 --> 20:59.490
We're training.

20:59.490 --> 21:03.490
We noticed that you're not good enough in the Dark Pond.

21:03.490 --> 21:05.490
The Dark Pond?

21:05.490 --> 21:07.490
Thank you for this.

21:07.490 --> 21:09.490
The Old Pond?

21:09.490 --> 21:13.490
But the legend says that the color of the picture is dark like the night.

21:13.490 --> 21:14.490
I painted it.

21:14.490 --> 21:15.490
How cute.

21:15.490 --> 21:19.490
It's an ancient magic tool.

21:19.490 --> 21:21.490
It's lost its magic.

21:21.490 --> 21:24.490
That Moonlight Stone is nowhere to be found.

21:24.490 --> 21:27.490
I want you to understand how important this is.

21:27.490 --> 21:29.490
What are you training?

21:29.490 --> 21:30.490
Huh?

21:30.490 --> 21:32.490
It's a skill, of course.

21:32.490 --> 21:36.490
You guys fight with the power of the spirit and the gods, right?

21:36.490 --> 21:40.490
We use our physical abilities to refine our skills.

21:40.490 --> 21:42.490
A special skill?

21:42.490 --> 21:43.490
I want to see it.

21:43.490 --> 21:44.490
It's a pain in the ass.

21:44.490 --> 21:46.490
Please do something about it.

21:46.490 --> 21:48.490
What are you talking about?

21:48.490 --> 21:50.490
Ikyulys Erlan.

21:50.490 --> 21:53.490
Here comes the Black-Eyed's magic.

21:53.490 --> 21:59.490
Wow, something's coming out.

21:59.490 --> 22:00.490
It's a fighting game.

22:01.490 --> 22:02.490
What are you looking at?

22:02.490 --> 22:05.490
This Saya!

22:05.490 --> 22:09.490
Yeah, it was thrown away, so I used it as a laundry host.

22:09.490 --> 22:11.490
Even if it's just a sword Saya.

22:11.490 --> 22:13.490
This is it!

22:13.490 --> 22:23.490
Where is that place?

22:30.490 --> 22:31.490
The top of the northern mountain.

22:31.490 --> 22:33.490
Huh? Are we going there now?

22:33.490 --> 22:35.490
It's pretty far.

22:35.490 --> 22:41.490
Hero.

22:41.490 --> 22:45.490
Don't let them get in your way.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.490
What?

22:46.490 --> 22:56.490
Um, why are you here suddenly, Elf?

22:58.490 --> 23:00.490
I found an ancient magic tool.

23:00.490 --> 23:01.490
An ancient magic tool?

23:01.490 --> 23:04.490
It's an ancient magic weapon.

23:04.490 --> 23:08.490
Elves value ancient culture, so they collect it.

23:08.490 --> 23:15.490
Hey, Black-Eyed, you're alone after all.

23:15.490 --> 23:17.490
I'm fine with Elves.

23:17.490 --> 23:20.490
Anyway, are there any monsters in this inn?

23:20.490 --> 23:24.490
The owner of the inn said that it was built with the power of the gods.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.490
Unless you can imitate it...

23:26.490 --> 23:28.490
It smells like burning.

23:28.490 --> 23:38.490
Elf's

23:55.610 --> 23:58.610
The End
