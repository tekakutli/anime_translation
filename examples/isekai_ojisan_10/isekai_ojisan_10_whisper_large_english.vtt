00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.500
This is where that suspicious man lives...

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
I have to protect Fujimi!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Um... Takaoka Takaoka...

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Hello!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.960
You came to play too?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.000
No, no...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.680
What are you doing?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.440
- Um, I'm here to help... - Brother Takafumi!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Hey, you're here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Huh?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Hey, nice to see you.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then, let's go to your room.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You had a really good dream the other day.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I caught a really nice girl the other day.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I took a video and uploaded it to the internet.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.360
Oh, a cute girl?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But isn't that already enough?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Right?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I think it's about time I go to bed.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Fujimi...

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.660
Excuse me!

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.880
Oh, welcome!

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.080
Huh? Why is Sawa here?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.960
Run! I'll take care of this, so you run!

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.340
What are you talking about?

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.260
These guys are scumbags who call women "women"!

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.900
I've only seen people like that in the comic books!

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.220
Sawa, you're reading something awful.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.940
Is Mr. Oshi home?

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.440
He's out for a bit.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.780
Huh?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.480
Fish?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.640
It's a gift from my grandmother.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.240
Normally, it's eggplant or cucumber.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.440
Hey, I hope he doesn't fly back.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.120
Don't worry. I just raised a flag.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.200
It's a spirit sign.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.920
A flag? A spirit?

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.800
If anyone finds out about his secret, it'll be a yukurasukiora.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.920
I know! If he gets yukurasukiora, it'll affect his personality!

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.860
I'm running away, Fushimi!

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.860
Huh?

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.660
Sawa?

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780
The cult is definitely in danger!

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.780
W-W-Wait!

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.420
Hey, mister!

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.040
Huh?

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.140
Huh?

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:17.400
I-I'm sorry, but don't involve Mr. Fushimiya!

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.120
A believer?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.560
You're exaggerating.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.120
Did you see it on the internet?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.700
It's all lies.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.620
It's safe.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.080
That's not how SEGA works.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.460
Geez!

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.800
It's the same way you talk when you're into the multi-player games.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.900
YouTuber?

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.500
I see. I thought you were a cult.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.180
What's that?

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.260
Mr. Takafumi is strange, but he's a good person.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.020
But why is Fushimi here?

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.260
Well, that's...

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.900
Hey, Chippu-peppa!

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.220
It's an old man!

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.820
It's definitely popular. You can use it.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.740
Oh, old man-jou is a great word.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.580
But if a 35-year-old man does it...

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.100
I see.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.900
-Fushimi. -Huh?

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.440
I want some coffee.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.100
I'll go get it.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.580
He's after Mr. Takafumi.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.700
Then I have to check.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.700
-Takafumi. -Huh?

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.000
Hey, wanna see a picture of me and Fushimi on a trip?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.220
Okay, I got it.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.300
Hey, it's close!

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.460
Let's sit down. Let's sit down for now.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.620
(Fushimi)

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.620
What do you think?

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.140
If you're just staring at my chest, I'm a loser.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.420
He's not eating my fingers!

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.140
Who's this guy?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.500
I don't know.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.660
A clerk?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.300
Oh, I see.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.740
Then what about this picture?

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.180
(Fushimi)

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.420
Why me?

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.660
Who's this guy?

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.060
What's that? You found me!

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.540
Hmm...

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.460
Takafumi, you were in elementary school?

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.100
What was Fushimi like in the past?

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.420
He was a bit cooler.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.860
Well, he hasn't changed much.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.820
I see.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.820
He might've been like the current Chiaki.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.580
Oh, that cute little brother?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.020
We haven't seen each other for two years.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.020
He's over there.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:38.220
Then I'll take a video to commemorate you.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.940
It's okay. I won't upload it online.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.340
You're already taking it?

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340
Yeah.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.260
What are you doing, Sumi?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.260
What?

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
(Fushimi)

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:07.460
What are you doing, Fushimi?

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.940
I know.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.340
I'm not that uninterested in women.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.820
That's my picture!

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.740
Takami?

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.540
You were talking about Fushimi when you were a kid.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.100
Are you in high school?

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.660
Y-Yes.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.300
Ikyurasu Erran.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.660
Fushimi from elementary school was...

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.540
Huh? This is...

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.540
What's going on?

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.620
It fell!

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.700
Stop! Stop!

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700
Oh.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.900
Spirit of memory,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.300
erase the past from the blind man's body.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.700
Chiaki, run!

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.700
Huh?

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.220
Sumi, what was that?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.180
Huh? In Sonny's room?

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.220
Sonny didn't make that.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.980
I'm going to go to bed.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:10.500
Mister...

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.500
Please don't try to erase your memory.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.780
Sorry.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.100
I remember being scolded for trying to erase my memory

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.300
in the other world.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.100
Huh? When?

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.060
That was...

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.700
Oh, right. At the hot spring.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.940
The hot spring...

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.660
The one you went to with Elph after you returned from the Demon Dragon?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.380
Yeah.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.860
What? What's the hot spring like in the other world?

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.940
Like, a service-related one?

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.340
I'll ask.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.620
Let's see...

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.220
It doesn't seem to be there.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.220
The spirit of memory optimizes the camera angle to suit the viewer.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.460
It seems that baths are especially considered for privacy.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.300
That's so advanced...

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.220
He's really a good listener.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.820
Ikyuras Elrond.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.660
Huh?

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:25.700
Elph?

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.500
Elphs are female, so there's no footage.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.180
That's a long bath.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.500
It's been a month, so it should be long.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.900
About 20 minutes left?

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.140
Hurry up!

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.220
Oh, 20 minutes...

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.580
The yukata?

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.420
Why?

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.300
Huh? Why?

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.500
Well, it's not a rewind...

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.380
A rewind!

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.980
Either way is fine, so hurry up!

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:54.100
What was that?

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.060
The armor's removal is a great use of the magic of the magic of the

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.340
Elgar royal family.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.060
Royal family, huh?

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.380
Yeah. You're changing your attitude now?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:12.340
I like Garfie's Varga because the motion of Graviton Thunder and Zero Drive Illusion is
super
cool.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.300
Not because I'm a royal family.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.940
You're you.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.140
Yeah.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.620
The hot spring's far away.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.940
We're almost there.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.940
We're here.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.940
This is it.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.940
Japanese?

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.940
A inn?

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.940
Why?

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.460
You know the Japanese Bahamaru language?

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.620
As Mabel said, it's really an transfer.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.940
Japanese Bahamaru...

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.420
The person who built this inn was a transfer from 20 years ago's Japanese Bahamaru.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.420
What?!

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.420
There's a transfer from the ancestors of Uncle and Mabel?

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.420
Is he here?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.420
Here?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.420
He...

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:08.420
The person who was in Grand Bahamaru 20 years ago, just 10 days ago.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.420
Murayama?

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.420
He's 88 years old this year.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.420
I see.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.420
"The Water of Purgatory"

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.420
You can really read it.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.420
What does purgatory mean?

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.420
To put it simply, it's a world where you purify yourself before you go to that world after
you
die.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.420
In other words, he recognized this world as such.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.420
You knew about it, Grandpa!

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.420
Yeah, it's amazing!

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:45.420
Yeah, the 90s were full of difficult words.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.420
I learned purgatory from the "The Evil King's Prologue to Purgatory."

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.420
"The Evil King's Prologue to Purgatory"?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.420
Hello, there.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.420
I'm Grandstone, the leader of the purgatory.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.420
You seem to know a lot about Sendai.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.420
Yeah, the transfer story is popular in the country, but...

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.420
It's a real shame that only one person, Shojiro, built this inn.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.420
Oh...

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.420
I've heard rumors that he brought inn from Japan Bahamaru.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.420
That's not true.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.420
If a person from another world dies, the person who brought it will disappear.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:28.420
When Sendai took his breath, his clothes and body disappeared right before his eyes.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.420
Oh, the new truth!

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.420
It's the same as the record of the knights of the Toshin-ken.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:40.420
It is said that the transfer from another world can be given one power from God.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.420
That is, the ability to freely operate material from living things.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.420
And he used the power of the knights to build this inn.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.420
Old man, you're organizing items?

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.420
You're talking about something really important.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.420
In action games, there are times when you can't skip a long demo part.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.420
In the meantime, doing something else is engraved in your body.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420
That's why.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.420
That's the story of the game.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.420
An important event to know the mystery of the world.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.420
Oak Gaon, let's go.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:24.420
Are the three of you doing the hot springs alone?

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.420
We're doing it for work, Ms. Nukariya.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.420
I wonder if Mr. Murayama treated her like this.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:36.420
By the way, old man, you're a bit rough with older people in another world, right?

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.420
Oh, that's true. I'm also polite to young shopkeepers.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.420
The legend is that it was recognized as a person.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.420
I have a great feeling.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.420
If you say it in a low posture, it was sold for three.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.420
Then the inn will be 400,000 pieces for two people.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.420
400,000 pieces? It's not stolen!

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.420
It's about 40,000 yen for a Japanese-yen coin.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.420
There are also high-priced coins.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.420
Oh, what?

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.420
Then the value of the coin when the old man was sold...

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.420
It's 30,000 yen.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.420
1,000 yen?

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.420
It wasn't even a yen.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.420
So here it is.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.420
It felt good to take a bath.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.420
Send it soon.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:24.420
You're dressed nicely, Yukata.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.420
Right?

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.420
The knight's flag 400 years ago had a kikata on it.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.420
Oh, you had a good book.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.420
It's called kimono, right?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.420
But it's a little plain.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.420
Oh, there.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.420
I see. Then my room is...

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.420
Here, here. The room next door.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.420
Why?

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.420
It's... it's only open here.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.420
Really?

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.420
But it's not for us.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:05.420
It's a trick to keep it away from other guests.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.420
I don't like ideas, but I can't help it.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.420
You don't like it, do you?

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:16.420
There's only one group of guests today, so I'll prepare another room.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:22.420
Come on.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.420
Let's go in.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.420
The children...

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.420
You're not bothered by the noise anymore, Tsundere-san.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.420
The futon is on the floor.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.420
It's soya.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.420
Tatami.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.420
This is tatami, right?

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.420
It smells unique.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.420
Do you miss it?

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.420
No. My room had a floor and a bed, so not that much.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.420
Bye.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:55.420
What's with this space?

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.420
What is this space?

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.420
It's a mystery space!

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.420
I can't believe you're in the same room.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.420
I'll sleep here, so you can use it all.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.420
Bye.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:11.420
What?

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.420
I've been looking for him for a month.

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.420
What a fool.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:22.420
Are you tired?

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.420
Hey!

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.420
Your legs are really tense.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.420
I was looking for you. What's that?

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.420
It seems it'll help you massage after a bath.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:43.420
I'm grateful to you.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.420
If it weren't for your warm heart, I might not have been able to return from the dragon.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.420
Ouch!

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.420
What?

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.420
Ouch!

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:09.420
Don't run away.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.420
The pot hurts because you're tired.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:19.420
It's my fault, so you have to loosen it.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.420
Ready...

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:27.420
It feels good! It feels good!

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.420
That's enough!

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.420
You idiot!

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.420
What are you doing?

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.420
I'm the one who's going to...

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.420
This is bad!

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.420
I'm scared!

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:47.420
It's heavy. Hold me.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.420
What?

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.420
A big face?

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.420
What?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.420
Stop!

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.420
Are you okay with going forward?

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.420
Isn't this bad?

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.420
There's nothing bad about it.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.420
But...

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.420
Can you hear me?

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.420
The great spirit of memories.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.420
Only the sage is here.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.420
The correction criteria is "It's okay to be rough."

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.420
"You can run away in the morning."

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.420
I'm counting on you.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.420
Fujimiya...

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.420
I'm going to revive you.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:27.420
Regsurd Stagga.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:33.420
Stagga Magnum.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.420
What are you guys doing?

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.420
Alicia...

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.420
Alicia is going to go first and take a peek.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.420
Wait! I just said I was curious.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420
A hero's first move?

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.420
The other group of guests were Alicia and the others?

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.420
Kuroki, I'm sorry.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.420
Kuroki, huh?

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.420
I'm sorry!

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.420
I was wondering what kind of relationship you two have.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.420
What kind of relationship do you think we have?

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.420
That's...

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.420
Let me see.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.420
Oh, I see.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.420
I'm in trouble.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.420
So easy.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.420
I'm glad. So easy.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.420
A hero?

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.420
You?

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.420
Here. This is for defeating hedgehogs.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.420
I see.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.420
Check if it's enough.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.420
No.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.420
I don't like it!

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.420
It's okay to trust others like that.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.420
But that sweetness will someday...

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.420
You're the ones I trusted.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.420
Not others.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:52.420
That's so cool!

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.420
Shut up, Madness Berserker.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.420
Then you two are...

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.420
Hero, I won't tell you the details,

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.420
but this ring is a gift from that orc face.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.420
She took it off!

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.420
She took off the most important part intentionally!

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.420
You didn't get the ring from him, did you?

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.420
What?

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.420
I-I wouldn't get it!

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.420
I'm not that considerate.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.420
You two.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.420
Have you been dating the hero for long?

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.420
Yeah, kind of.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.420
So, who do you think will win the hero's heart?

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.420
Elf?

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.420
I guess you have to decide by a duel.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.420
Wait.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.420
What?

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.420
No.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.420
I have the right to choose.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.420
I knew it, but you're so mean!

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.420
Are childhood friends that weak?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.420
So, what are you two doing in the mountains?

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.420
We're training.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.420
We noticed that you're not good enough in the Dark Pond.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.420
The Dark Pond?

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.420
Thank you for this.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.420
The Old Pond?

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.420
But the legend says that the color of the picture is dark like the night.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.420
I painted it.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.420
How cute.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.420
It's an ancient magic tool.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.420
It's lost its magic.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.420
That Moonlight Stone is nowhere to be found.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.420
I want you to understand how important this is.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.420
What are you training?

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.420
Huh?

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.420
It's a skill, of course.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.420
You guys fight with the power of the spirit and the gods, right?

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.420
We use our physical abilities to refine our skills.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.420
A special skill?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.420
I want to see it.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.420
It's a pain in the ass.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.420
Please do something about it.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.420
What are you talking about?

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.420
Ikyulys Erlan.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.420
Here comes the Black-Eyed's magic.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:59.420
Wow, something's coming out.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.420
It's a fighting game.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.420
What are you looking at?

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.420
This Saya!

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.420
Yeah, it was thrown away, so I used it as a laundry host.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.420
Even if it's just a sword Saya.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.420
This is it!

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:28.420
Where is that place?

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.420
The top of the northern mountain.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.420
Huh? Are we going there now?

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.420
It's pretty far.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:41.420
Hero.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.420
Don't let them get in your way.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.420
What?

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:58.420
Um, why are you here suddenly, Elf?

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.420
I found an ancient magic tool.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.420
An ancient magic tool?

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.420
It's an ancient magic weapon.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.420
Elves value ancient culture, so they collect it.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:15.420
Hey, Black-Eyed, you're alone after all.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.420
I'm fine with Elves.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.420
Anyway, are there any monsters in this inn?

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.420
The owner of the inn said that it was built with the power of the gods.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.420
Unless you can imitate it...

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.420
It smells like burning.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:55.540
Elf's

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.540
The End
