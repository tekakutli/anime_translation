00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.220
Sashish...

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.660
Here. That weird guy...

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.300
I have to protect Fuji.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.220
Uh... Highoka Takaoka...

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.540
Shit. It's hard.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.380
Hello!

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.760
Fifi! Fifi! Fifi!

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.760
Whoa!

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.800
Did your sister come to see you?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.900
What? No. No...

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.500
What are you doing?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.060
Oh. Hey. Help...

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.000
Takashi.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.580
Hey. Good to see you.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.620
Well...

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.080
Oh, uh...

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.500
Bye. Let's go to your room.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.000
The other day, I got a really good meth.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
I'm filming it and I'm putting it online.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.010
Oh. Little meth. Oh...

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.010
But the meth isn't enough, is it?

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.010
You're right. I don't know if I can push a Surro.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.010
Fujio...

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.660
What I mean. Meaning.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.500
I'm sorry to bother you!

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500
Oh, hello.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.040
What?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.000
Get out! I'll take care of it. Fuji, run!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.300
What are you talking about?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.300
They're cuses that bar women for meth!

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.880
I've only seen him in the press!

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880
Eguy calls for you in the morning.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.840
Is there a cow?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.300
I'm out for a bit.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.780
What?

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.780
Fish?

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.520
Obana, you're ready.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.660
It's usually Nass or Curlyjon.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.360
Hey! You're not coming home!

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.660
It's okay. It was warm.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.780
It's an animic prison.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.240
And?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.520
Ray?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.780
If they find out about my uncle's secret, It's an Iquila.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.820
I know! It's the worst person I've ever met.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.820
Oh...

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.820
We gotta get out of here!

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.900
What?

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.660
Oh, my God!

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.740
Colt's definitely in trouble!

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.240
Uncle!

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.160
Oh, shit.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.860
Oh, shit.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.440
Oh, shit.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.240
Oh, shit.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.740
What?

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.620
I'm sorry to bother you

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.820
Don't involve Mr. Fujisawa.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.000
A believer?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.120
Did you see that on the Internet?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.620
That's all lies. Safe!

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.200
Not at all!

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.540
You know, when I was falling for you, That's how you talk to Mizawa Oba.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.740
YouTuber?

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.980
My uncle's video...

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.580
I thought I was a competition.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.240
What do you mean?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.320
You're an old man. He's weird, but he's nice.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.740
But why are they here?

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.320
It's...

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.980
Powder!

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.320
It's my uncle!

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.500
It's definitely going to be popular! You can use it!

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.580
All right!

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.580
Uncle, it's so nice.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.580
But my 35-year-old uncle... I'm going to do it.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.280
I see.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.240
Bugs!

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.440
I want a cup of coffee or something.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.120
Oh, I'm coming in.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.580
That's what you're trying to do.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.660
Well, then we have to find out.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.740
Takashi!

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.940
Hey, do you see the pictures of your trip with the worm?

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.780
All right, all right, all right.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.240
A little closer.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.320
Sit down!

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.320
I'll sit down for a while.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.820
What do you think?

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.900
If this is what you're looking at, You son of a bitch.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.400
Come on. That's him. To the expanding fingers. You can't eat me

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.240
Oh.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.320
Who is this guy?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.900
Oh, I don't know.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.700
Mr. Delin?

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.320
Oh, my God.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.900
What about this picture?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.400
What, me? Why?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.480
Who is this guy?

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.560
What's that?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.140
Is it from elementary school?

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.240
What did you look like back then?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.240
He was a little cooler.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.320
Well, isn't it much different?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.400
Yeah.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.480
If you call me Shh, I think he might have been like you.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.560
Oh, that little brother.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.640
I haven't done it in two years.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.220
I'm right there.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.300
Oh.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.300
I'll see you later. Let's get a video of it.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.380
It's okay. It's okay I'm not gonna let that happen on the internet.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.380
You've already taken it?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.460
Yeah.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.380
What are you doing?

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.460
What?

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.460
Uh...

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:07.040
Wow! What are you doing?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.120
I know.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.200
You're not interested in women, are you?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.800
Oh, that's my picture!

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.880
Hmm.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.960
Yeah. Ah.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.040
I don't know.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.120
Hey. Takashi?

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.200
God?

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.280
You were talking about Mr. Fujimiya's childhood.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.360
Is Sawae from high school?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.440
Oh, yeah.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.520
Iculas Ellan.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.600
Fujimei was in elementary school.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.680
Oh, my God.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.760
What?!

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.840
I fell! I fell!

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.920
Stop! Stop!

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.000
Oh.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.600
The memory spirit is set in the direction of protection!

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.680
Come on, run!

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.760
What?

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.120
Smine, what's that?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.200
What, in Sonny?

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.280
Sonny, I didn't make anything like that.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.360
Look, I'm going to be happy.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:13.360
Don't try to erase your memory in the dark.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.440
I'm sorry, yeah.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.520
You know, in the other world, I've been mad at you not to erase your memory lightly.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.600
When?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.600
It's a hot spring.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.680
Hmm?

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.760
Hot springs.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.840
Did you go with the Elves after your uncle got back from the front?

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.920
Yeah.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.000
What kind of hot springs are they?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.080
I don't know.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.160
I'll ask him.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.240
Uh...

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.320
They say there's no Polo.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:52.200
A memory spirit is trying to compact a camera angle for viewing.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.280
He's taking the bathroom into consideration, especially his privacy.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.360
I don't know.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.440
That's Mr. Kikbari.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.000
Iculas Elron.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Ellan.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Mr. Elves.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Elves are actresses, so they can't be seen.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
How long has it been?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I've been in a bath for a month.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
About 20 minutes?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Fast forward.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Oh, 20 minutes.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
A yukata?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Why?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
What? Why?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Hurry back!

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
It doesn't matter. Come on!

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
What was that?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Armoring is an application of rapid storage magic.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
The Elga family's occult.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Royal.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
What?!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I like Garhea's Valgar.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And I'm going to show you how this works.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It's super cool.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Not because you're royal.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You're you.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It's far from hot springs.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We're almost there.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Here we are. Here we are.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Japanese, travel, why?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Do you know the Japanese language?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Like Mabel said, I'm really a human being.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
How do you do?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I built this place.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
The one who died 20 years ago.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
There were other natural survivors besides my uncle and Mabel's ancestors.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
You there?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Here.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It's about 10 days from a book 20 years ago.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Murama?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
She's 88 years old last year.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Okay.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
It's hot water.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You really can read.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
What does that mean?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I don't know.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Before he died.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It's a world of shit.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I mean, he's got this world.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
They must have recognized it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I mean... He's... This world. I think he's got the full picture.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Yeah, great.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Grandpa. You knew him well.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
They're gonna be in the middle of a hard zone.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The Confederate is a secret painting of the Snake King.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I learned that in the Ministry of the Secret Pictures, The Snake Killers.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The Republic of Snake Killers?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
You have a visitor?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Welcome.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Purgatory's keyboard head. I'll talk to Grandz.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I know Grand Island.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Your daughter's on Sendai.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
He seems quite familiar.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I don't know.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It's very popular in the country.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
It's going to happen.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
This is the place. Mr. Shoichi. One. It's not that far away. It's a leaf.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's an eyebrow.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
From the Japanese bahamal.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
He said he brought every one of them.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I've seen theories.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
What I brought is a rule that goes away.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
When Sendai passed away,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
His clothes and body disappeared right in front of his feet.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Oh, there's new facts!

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
That doesn't match the record on the ticket.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
It's... A battle sword. It doesn't match the knight's records.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
He said God gave him one power.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It's called Sendai.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
That's why I'm here.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I'll give you the power of the big district.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I built this place.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Uncle... do you have an Idem?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
You're talking about something very important.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It's called action games.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So let's take a look at this.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I've got a lot to do. In the meantime, we're gonna do something else.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.380
There's something else in between.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.580
That's why I'm here.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.660
That's the game, right?

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.380
And that's what I'm going to talk about today.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.380
Orcgaon Let's go.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:24.860
The hot springs are only for the three of us.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.220
To work. I don't know.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.220
Murama-san must have been treated like this.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.980
You know what?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.620
In a different world, you have to be very rough.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.220
Yeah, sure.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.340
I'm sorry.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.780
It's not until they recognize you as a person.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.220
I can feel it.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.300
If you're in a coma, they'll sell you three.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.860
Okay, homework.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.700
Two, please. Four hundred thousand.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.900
Four hundred thousand?

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.900
It's about 400,000 yen.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.540
There's a lot of money in there.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.800
Oh, my God.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.160
So it's worth it when your uncle was sold.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
30 fights.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.240
It wasn't Endes.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.280
So here we are.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.320
It was nice to be in Flo.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.280
Fast forward.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:24.160
How did you do it?

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.400
Right?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.240
The knight's electricity, 400 years ago, had a bolt on it.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.080
Oh, you used to have a book like this.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.080
You call it a kimono.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.240
But I'm going to have a little steaming.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.280
Oh, there it is.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.560
Well, then, my room...

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.760
Here. Here.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.600
Ayveh.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.240
Why?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.640
It's the only place I've ever met.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.920
Oh, my God.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.400
Oh, my God.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.280
But besides us,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.840
It's like being away and trying not to fit in with other customers.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.720
I don't want to have an eye too, but I can't.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.200
Oh. I don't like it

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.360
There's only one other group of customers today.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.840
I'm going after another room.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:22.440
Come on.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.880
Let's go in.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.200
Children

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.080
You don't have to pretend anymore, Mr. Zunder.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.160
You look like you're off-duty.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.320
That's right.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.880
Powder!

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.360
It's a mess, isn't it?

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.120
It smells so good.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120
Do you miss it?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.520
Oh...

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.920
No, I had a bed in my room.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.920
Not that far.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.720
Bye.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:56.680
Oh, my God, this space!

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.160
There it is!

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.680
I don't know.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.000
I'll sleep here. You can use all of you.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Bye.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
What?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I've been looking for you for a month.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Too many idiots.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:19.000
You're tired.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Hey.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You're right. Your leg muscles are tight.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Oh, I'm gonna find you?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
You.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I don't know.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
The floor massage works.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I'm grateful to you.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
If it weren't for your warm heart

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Maybe he couldn't get back from Luu.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Ow!

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Ow!

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Ow!

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Ow!

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Ow!

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
What?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Stop.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Stop.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Ow!

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
It hurts.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Huh.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Don't run away.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
The pain in the jar is evidence of fatigue.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
It's my fault.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Here we go.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
That's right. That's right.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
It feels good!

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
It feels good!

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I didn't say anything!

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
You idiot!

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Stop.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
It's my fault.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
What?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I'm scared.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I'm scared.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I'm scared.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
You.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Hold him.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
I'll take care of it.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
What?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Stop!

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Is everything okay? Isn't it bad?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
No, but...

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Can you hear me?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
I ask you to remember the Holy Spirit.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
There's only a saint here.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
It's all right.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
We'll be gone in the morning.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Pleased to meet you.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Fujimiya.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
It's gonna play.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Legsurd Stagga

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Stagga Magnan

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
What are you doing?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Alicia.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Alicia.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Take the lead.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Hey, hey!

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I told you I care, didn't I?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
All the way to the Dragon Palace?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
He's in the other room.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Alicia and the others?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Hey, Croki.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I'm sorry.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Blackkie.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
I'm sorry.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Me.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I don't know what the relationship is.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
What does it look like?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
It's...

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Come on. Come on.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
That's what it looks like.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I'm sorry.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
You.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
You.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
You.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
That's what it looks like.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I'm in trouble.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Good.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Dragonhouse?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
You?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Here.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
It's my share of the needle-cuttering.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
That's right.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
See if it's enough.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Okay.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
That's not good.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
It's fine to trust others like that.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I'm sure someday it'll be sweet.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
I trusted you.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I'm not a stranger.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
It's cool.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Shut up, you piece of shit.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
What are you two doing?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
It's a dragonhouse.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I don't want any details.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
These fingers are shaped by that orc face.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I didn't.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
It's really important.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
I did it on purpose.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
He didn't give you his finger, did he?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
What?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
The black tree doesn't care about me.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
You two.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
How long have you known this dragonhouse?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Yeah.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So who's going to get the dragonhouse?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Mr. Elves?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Yeah. I don't know.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Hey.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
What?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
What?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
What?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I can't.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
There's a choice here.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I knew it, but it's good.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
You're so weak from childhood.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And what are you doing in a mountain like this?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
It's a practice.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
That's why we're here.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
The new plan's off.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Here. Thank you.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
The rest of the day?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
But with electrons, the color of the painting must be black, like dark.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I painted it. It's cute.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
It's an ancient instrument.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
They're losing the square.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
That moon luminous.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
There's nowhere else to go.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I want you to understand how serious this is.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
What are you doing with your training?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
What?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
You're on the sidelines.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
They will fight with the power of the Holy Spirit and God.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Our warrior careers are designed to sharpen our physical abilities.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I need you to master your skills.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
That's what I'm talking about.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I'd like to see it.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
No, it wouldn't.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
We'll figure it out.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
What are you talking about?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Yquilas Ellan

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
There it is. Blackwood's fucking magic.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Oh, my God! It's coming out!

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Wake up, wake up!

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
What are you looking at?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
What are you doing?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Oh!

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I used it for laundry hosts.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Even with the sword Sasha.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
This is it.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Where is that place?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Iron pen in the North Mountain.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
What? Are you going now?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
It's a long way.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
You're a brave man.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Don't let it turn on.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
What?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Um...

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
What happened to the Elves?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
I found an ancient instrument.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Ancient magic tools?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Ignacia's strong magic weapon.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
The Elves cherish their old culture.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
I'm collecting them.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Yeah.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Hey, Black Tree.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
You're the Elves, aren't you?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
The Elves will be fine.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I don't know.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Are you okay with demons?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
The master of the inn.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
It was built by the power of God.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Unless you let me in.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
It smells like an attack.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
(GRUNTING)
