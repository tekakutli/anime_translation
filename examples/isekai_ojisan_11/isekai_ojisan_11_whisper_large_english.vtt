WEBVTT

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A hypnotizing spell?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He's using the door on Renia?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Hold him down, Liger!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Yes!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Edgar, you take care of Kabe!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Roger!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Thank you, Slard-Seld!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's the Magical Wind Waker! If we don't defeat it, we won't be able to use Kuroki's magic!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If you hide, we'll catch you!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Hey!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Then leave it to me!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's dangerous, old man!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's right.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If it weren't for the magic, I'd have had two or three bad grades in physical education,
and
I wouldn't have been of any use.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
How many grades is he getting?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I think he's not getting one because he's been doing it seriously.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You don't remember?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Yeah, it's different from when I was holding him in my arms.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He's scary, but he's become stronger because he's yearning for that strength.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's about the old man!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
He's being respected so much!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Wait!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
His strength is real.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What's with that?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Gigant Hunter, Doldor Rexdor!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I was wrong.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm sorry, old man.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You two can watch over him.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I can't lose to the Black Knight.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Yeah, the Black Knight is amazing, too.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
He's a weird guy.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Old man!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Hey, old man!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm begging you!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
That's enough!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Let me see him first!

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Old man!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm sorry, old man.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
"The Black Knight"

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.780
He's not coming out.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.620
Will he be okay?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.280
I believe in your strength.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.280
You'll get better.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.700
You're right.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.580
So let's wait while watching the video.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.120
Okay!

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.120
Hurry! Let's continue!

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.120
You...

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:39.220
Um...

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.840
It's the order of wind, fire, and ice.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:56.240
Old man!

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.740
He's alive!

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.740
You!

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.280
- Old man! - That must hurt!

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:17.000
"The

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.200
Safe"

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.320
But what was that attack?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.160
It was an elf.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.620
Old man!

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.840
Is he okay now?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.920
Yeah, of course.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.040
That was an elf's new equipment.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.260
It was Saya, who went to get it in a hurry.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.880
What? Saya?

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.880
It's a super-weapon-like light form.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.880
It seems to be useful.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.880
Glasses! A monitor!

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.880
Saya's fine with that, but what's with the glasses?

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.880
That's an ancient magic tool too.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.880
Oak's not right!

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.880
This way!

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880
Idiot!

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.880
This way!

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.880
He ran away!

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.880
So elves hunt humans in half-play because they're royal.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.880
This is all the elf's fault.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.880
Oh, what's that bird?

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.880
Isn't it amazing how it can seal magic?

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.880
I heard later that

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.880
it has a demonic component that can control spirits.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.880
Really? That's the theory?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.880
It sounds like a fantasy.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.880
No, it's like, "That bird stinks, I don't want to work!"

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.880
That's what it sounds like.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.880
Oh, I see.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.880
It stinks.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.880
Remus, Whit, Zaldona!

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.880
It still stinks. It won't work.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.880
How much does the demon's breath stink?

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.880
The spirit doesn't seem to care.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.880
Well, that's how we got back to Alicia and the others.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.880
No!

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.880
They're being controlled!

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:19.880
Alicia!

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880
Kuroki!

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.880
Oh, a fire!

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.880
God, give me a light to heal!

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880
Thanks!

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.880
Can't you get rid of sleep with that magic tool?

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880
No way!

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.880
Even if the temperature is high,

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.880
the essence of the god's power is to heal the mind and body.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.880
It's powerless against all the simple violence.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
That's right!

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.880
Is there a switch to activate it?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.880
Elves have a special function.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.880
A switch?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.880
Like twisting it.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.880
Huh?

00:07:51.880 --> 00:08:08.880
Kuroki, what are you doing?

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.880
Isn't that a harmful light?

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.880
Oh, yes, that's right.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.880
Is this light the effect of the wand?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.880
Alicia, try to get rid of sleep.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.880
Oh, I got it.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.880
But...

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.880
This magic is to make my mind peaceful

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.880
and to make my life easier by making it work with the other person.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.880
What?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880
I can't hear you.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.880
I'm sorry, but please don't look at me.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.880
Oh, sorry.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.880
It's hard to use magic, isn't it?

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.880
(Panting)

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.880
(Gasping)

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.880
Dear god,

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.880
let the heart of those who are bewildered

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.880
be united with me!

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:09.880
What did I do?

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.880
I'm sorry.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.880
You did it, Kuroki!

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.880
Alicia!

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.480
Shura Iron

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.620
Shura Iron

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.780
My technique!

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:34.160
Alicia, are you okay?

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.840
Huh?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.380
Me?

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.540
Uncle, what's this?

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.520
With the magic

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:51.520
that was strengthened with the wand, Alicia was able to use the techniques of her comrades.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520
Really?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.520
She's really become a hero.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.900
Wait!

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.900
Shura Iron

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:24.820
Damn, a

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:34.820
little bit of magic, huh?

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.820
I'm finally here.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.820
Raidoka Nivaldo Baglhild.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:49.820
The spirits of the water here are really angry.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.820
Prepare yourself.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:02.820
Baglhild

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.820
Baglhild

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.820
Baglhild

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:23.820
Alright.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.820
Thank you very much.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.820
As expected of the hero.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.820
I'll come back.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:41.820
Uncle, I'm sorry for being scared earlier.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.820
No, it's really nothing.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.820
For the time being, the barrier is blocked by the outer wall.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.820
Please check the bath.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:57.820
It's so free.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.820
You can go to the river while watching the sunrise.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.820
It's a big one.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.820
It's a great barrier.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.820
I can't believe I was able to use this kind of magic.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.820
I've put a big one on before.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.820
I'm glad it was useful.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.820
Yay!

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:28.460
We can finally sell it to a barren inn with no

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.820
Is that what you thought?

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.820
It's exactly what Fevia said.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:22.820
What are you talking about, Rinea?

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.820
Well, that's why the fight is over here.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.820
I'm glad you're happy with the result.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.820
But this is a story about being angry at me for not erasing my memory, right?

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.820
Oh, that's right.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.820
After the battle, I went back to the hot spring.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.820
Send it quickly.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.820
Oh, yeah.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.820
Excuse me.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.820
I'm so tired of my voice.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.820
I'm so tired of being burned by a demon that I can't tell a man from a woman.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.820
Well, I'll send it quickly.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.820
As it is!

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:17.820
Kuroki, I'm wearing my clothes.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.820
What?

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.820
Did you think I was naked?

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.820
Well, it's a hot spring.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.820
That's...

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.820
That's not true.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.820
Don't go!

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.820
Yes, sir!

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.820
Sir?

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.820
No, no.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.820
This isn't because I saw something sexy.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.820
I know.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.820
You've got your memory back, haven't you?

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.820
There's no one who would look at something sexy and talk about it.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.820
Thank you. I was careless.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.820
I erased the memories of seeing Alicia naked.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.820
You're so mean.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.820
Oh.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.820
I know.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.820
You're not interested in a little girl like me, are you?

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820
Is that so?

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.820
I'm 20 years old.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.820
That's right.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.820
We're the same age?

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.820
Aren't you in your 30s?

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.820
I'm in my 20s. I just turned 20.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.820
What month were you born?

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.820
I was born in August.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.820
November.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:42.820
I'm... underage.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.820
Alicia is older.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.820
I agree.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.820
I can't see it.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.820
But this birthday might be wrong.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.820
What do you mean?

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:01.820
I don't have any memories before I was nine.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.820
Kuroki, can you show me a spell to show my memory?

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820
It was August 11 years ago.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.820
Sure.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.820
Ikyuras Erlan.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.820
My first memory was of the blood and the horse carriage.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.820
I was taken out by the goblins in the carriage.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.820
I was saved by the police from the village where Liga and Edgar lived.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.820
I couldn't remember anything else after I was hit in the head.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.820
This was all I had.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.820
In the end, I couldn't find my family.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.820
I think I was killed by the goblins.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:16:12.800
After that, I was named Alicia by the Idyllian

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.820
Alicia, do you remember things?

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.820
Of course.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.820
You have no memories of the past, so everything you've experienced is a treasure.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:06.820
Well, that's why August isn't my birthday.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.820
I erased your memory twice.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.820
What? What are you kidding?

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.820
I can use the Ikyuras Kiora memory erasing spell.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.820
Memory erasing...

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.820
Why? I...

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:49.820
Kuroky, what kind of memory did you erase?

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.820
You'll get nosebleeds. Be careful.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.820
Nosebleeds?

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:59.820
The first time I erased it was when I defeated the goblin army with Mr. Dold.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.820
The second time was when I captured the Shinnan Labyrinth from the back door.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:14.820
Then, the goblin punishment, the crusaders, and the hero's title...

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.820
It's not me, it's Kuroky!

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:18.820
I'm not that great.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.820
But you fixed the barrier of the sealed city without telling anyone!

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.820
That's the way the legendary hero does it.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.820
So you were watching.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.820
You can reveal the truth. I'm going to run away.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.820
What do you mean? Why?

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.820
I'm the one who broke the barrier.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.820
What?

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:45.820
Why would you do that?

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.820
I was just wondering if I could.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:54.820
You don't play with the lives of the people half-played, do you?

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:59.820
I came from a different world.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.820
I'm a Japanese Bahamal, just like Mr. Murayama, who made the Purgatory.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.820
What? You?

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.820
My goal is the Purgatory.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:14.820
So I thought that the strongest attack magic would be used on the strong barrier,

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.820
and the distortion of the space-time would be the foothold of the Purgatory.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.820
As a result, the barrier was just broken.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.820
Um...

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:31.820
Like the hypnotism today, you tried to make a hole in this and that wall?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.820
To put it simply, that's what it is.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.820
Is it over with the two times I said earlier that you erased my memories?

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.820
Yeah, that's all.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.820
Don't use that kind of magic anymore!

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.820
Not on me, not on anyone!

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.820
It's for my life. If necessary, I'll erase it from now on.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.820
Kuroki!

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.820
I don't want to forget about you!

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.820
I don't want you to forget about me either!

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.820
...

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:11.820
I understand.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.820
I won't use the Purgatory magic on Alicia anymore.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.820
That's not enough!

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.820
I won't erase my memories of Alicia either.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.820
How about this?

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.820
Promise. Okay?

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.820
Yeah.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.820
Okay.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.820
I'll use that to hit you.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.820
Ah, but...

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.820
What is it this time?

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.820
I see. I was reciting while taking notes earlier.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.820
Again? Did I erase some memories earlier?

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.820
What kind of memories?

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.820
No, it's just that my skin...

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.820
I remember! Reproduce it.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.820
It's not a big deal, so it's fine!

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.820
No! I promised.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.820
I won't erase my memories of Alicia.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.820
I just saw it for a bit!

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.820
You saw it? What did you see?

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.820
Um, then...

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.820
Can you close your eyes?

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.820
Oh, yeah.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.820
...

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:29.820
No way...

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.820
I can't get through this...

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.820
No!

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.820
No!

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:49.820
I'm getting old...

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:55.820
My friend, the demons attack, Alicia gets angry, and the elves shoot.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.180
It wasn't a purgatory, but a hellish

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.820
It was a mess.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.820
What should I call you from now on?

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.820
Kurokikon?

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.820
No, I guess it's fine as it is now.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:12.820
You erased too many memories, and your head is going crazy, right?

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.820
Yeah...

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.820
Hey, mister, you should try to keep your memories simple.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.820
That's right!

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.820
I erased some bad memories in the bathroom earlier, right?

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.820
Huh? I didn't erase any.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.820
But...

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.820
You look strangely refreshed.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.820
Oh, no, no. That's not magic.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.820
It's a technique to kill sensitivity.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:36.820
What is it?

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.820
In theory, if you don't feel anything bad in your heart, you won't get any damage, right?

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.820
That's what you do.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.820
It's a technique to kill before your heart is killed.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.820
When you're in your mid-20s, your use rate will go up.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.820
You two should practice from now on.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.820
I'm not doing it!

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.820
Right, Takafu?

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.820
If you don't have a heart...

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.820
Yoshi.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.820
Okay, fine.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:02.820
Stop it!

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.820
In the 20 years of the Heisei era, there were many things that happened.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.820
You're useful, mister.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.820
Takafumi! Hey, leave it alone!

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:17.820
From now on, no matter what happens, if I have this technique, I feel like I can overcome
it.
