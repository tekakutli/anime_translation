WEBVTT

00:12.897 --> 00:14.895
A hypnotizing spell?

00:14.895 --> 00:17.892
He's using the door on Renia?

00:17.892 --> 00:21.888
Hold him down, Liger!

00:21.888 --> 00:22.887
Yes!

00:22.887 --> 00:23.886
Edgar, you take care of Kabe!

00:23.886 --> 00:24.885
Roger!

00:24.885 --> 00:30.879
Thank you, Slard-Seld!

00:38.871 --> 00:42.867
It's the Magical Wind Waker! If we don't defeat it, we won't be able to use Kuroki's magic!

00:42.867 --> 00:44.865
If you hide, we'll catch you!

00:44.865 --> 00:45.864
Hey!

00:45.864 --> 00:47.862
Then leave it to me!

00:47.862 --> 00:50.859
What?

00:50.859 --> 00:52.857
That's dangerous, old man!

00:52.857 --> 00:54.855
That's right.

00:54.855 --> 01:01.848
If it weren't for the magic, I'd have had two or three bad grades in physical education,
and
I wouldn't have been of any use.

01:01.848 --> 01:04.845
How many grades is he getting?

01:04.845 --> 01:08.841
I think he's not getting one because he's been doing it seriously.

01:08.841 --> 01:10.839
You don't remember?

01:10.839 --> 01:15.834
Yeah, it's different from when I was holding him in my arms.

01:15.834 --> 01:20.829
He's scary, but he's become stronger because he's yearning for that strength.

01:20.829 --> 01:22.827
This is...

01:22.827 --> 01:24.825
It's about the old man!

01:24.825 --> 01:27.822
He's being respected so much!

01:27.822 --> 01:29.820
Wait!

01:29.820 --> 01:31.818
His strength is real.

01:33.816 --> 01:36.813
What's with that?

01:36.813 --> 01:39.810
Gigant Hunter, Doldor Rexdor!

01:39.810 --> 01:47.802
I'm sorry.

01:47.802 --> 01:49.800
I was wrong.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.798
I'm sorry, old man.

01:51.798 --> 01:58.791
I'm going to the bathroom.

01:58.791 --> 02:02.787
You two can watch over him.

02:04.785 --> 02:07.782
I can't lose to the Black Knight.

02:07.782 --> 02:10.779
Yeah, the Black Knight is amazing, too.

02:10.779 --> 02:12.777
He's a weird guy.

02:12.777 --> 02:14.775
Old man!

02:14.775 --> 02:16.773
Hey, old man!

02:16.773 --> 02:17.772
I'm begging you!

02:17.772 --> 02:18.771
That's enough!

02:18.771 --> 02:21.768
Let me see him first!

02:21.768 --> 02:22.767
Old man!

02:22.767 --> 02:24.765
I'm sorry, old man.

02:24.765 --> 02:25.764
I'm sorry.

02:25.764 --> 02:30.759
"The Black Knight"

04:10.858 --> 04:12.437
He's not coming out.

04:12.437 --> 04:14.275
Will he be okay?

04:14.275 --> 04:16.932
I believe in your strength.

04:16.932 --> 04:18.930
You'll get better.

04:18.930 --> 04:20.349
You're right.

04:20.349 --> 04:23.226
So let's wait while watching the video.

04:23.226 --> 04:24.764
Okay!

04:24.764 --> 04:26.762
Hurry! Let's continue!

04:26.762 --> 04:27.761
You...

04:27.761 --> 04:37.751
Um...

04:38.850 --> 04:42.467
It's the order of wind, fire, and ice.

04:42.467 --> 04:52.457
Old man!

04:55.853 --> 04:57.352
He's alive!

04:57.352 --> 04:58.351
You!

04:58.351 --> 05:03.885
- Old man! - That must hurt!

05:03.885 --> 05:13.875
"The

05:16.593 --> 05:17.791
Safe"

05:17.791 --> 05:19.909
But what was that attack?

05:19.909 --> 05:21.747
It was an elf.

05:21.747 --> 05:23.206
Old man!

05:23.206 --> 05:24.425
Is he okay now?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.503
Yeah, of course.

05:26.503 --> 05:28.620
That was an elf's new equipment.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.838
It was Saya, who went to get it in a hurry.

05:30.838 --> 05:32.457
What? Saya?

05:34.455 --> 05:37.452
It's a super-weapon-like light form.

05:37.452 --> 05:40.449
It seems to be useful.

05:40.449 --> 05:45.444
Glasses! A monitor!

05:45.444 --> 05:47.442
Saya's fine with that, but what's with the glasses?

05:47.442 --> 05:49.440
That's an ancient magic tool too.

05:49.440 --> 05:54.435
Oak's not right!

05:54.435 --> 05:56.433
This way!

05:56.433 --> 05:57.432
Idiot!

05:57.432 --> 06:01.428
This way!

06:01.428 --> 06:02.427
He ran away!

06:02.427 --> 06:07.422
So elves hunt humans in half-play because they're royal.

06:07.422 --> 06:09.420
This is all the elf's fault.

06:09.420 --> 06:13.416
Oh, what's that bird?

06:13.416 --> 06:15.414
Isn't it amazing how it can seal magic?

06:15.414 --> 06:17.412
I heard later that

06:17.412 --> 06:23.406
it has a demonic component that can control spirits.

06:23.406 --> 06:25.404
Really? That's the theory?

06:25.404 --> 06:27.402
It sounds like a fantasy.

06:27.402 --> 06:32.397
No, it's like, "That bird stinks, I don't want to work!"

06:32.397 --> 06:33.396
That's what it sounds like.

06:33.396 --> 06:35.394
Oh, I see.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.392
It stinks.

06:37.392 --> 06:40.389
Remus, Whit, Zaldona!

06:40.389 --> 06:47.382
It still stinks. It won't work.

06:47.382 --> 06:49.380
How much does the demon's breath stink?

06:49.380 --> 06:52.377
The spirit doesn't seem to care.

06:52.377 --> 06:57.372
Well, that's how we got back to Alicia and the others.

06:57.372 --> 06:59.370
No!

06:59.370 --> 07:05.364
They're being controlled!

07:05.364 --> 07:15.354
Alicia!

07:19.350 --> 07:20.349
Kuroki!

07:20.349 --> 07:22.347
Oh, a fire!

07:22.347 --> 07:24.345
God, give me a light to heal!

07:24.345 --> 07:25.344
Thanks!

07:25.344 --> 07:31.338
Can't you get rid of sleep with that magic tool?

07:31.338 --> 07:32.337
No way!

07:32.337 --> 07:34.335
Even if the temperature is high,

07:34.335 --> 07:37.332
the essence of the god's power is to heal the mind and body.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.329
It's powerless against all the simple violence.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.328
That's right!

07:41.328 --> 07:43.326
Is there a switch to activate it?

07:43.326 --> 07:45.324
Elves have a special function.

07:45.324 --> 07:47.322
A switch?

07:47.322 --> 07:49.320
Like twisting it.

07:50.319 --> 07:51.318
Huh?

07:51.318 --> 08:01.308
Kuroki, what are you doing?

08:08.301 --> 08:11.298
Isn't that a harmful light?

08:11.298 --> 08:14.295
Oh, yes, that's right.

08:14.295 --> 08:17.292
Is this light the effect of the wand?

08:17.292 --> 08:20.289
Alicia, try to get rid of sleep.

08:20.289 --> 08:22.287
Oh, I got it.

08:22.287 --> 08:23.286
But...

08:23.286 --> 08:27.282
This magic is to make my mind peaceful

08:27.282 --> 08:31.278
and to make my life easier by making it work with the other person.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.277
What?

08:32.277 --> 08:33.276
I can't hear you.

08:33.276 --> 08:37.272
I'm sorry, but please don't look at me.

08:37.272 --> 08:39.270
Oh, sorry.

08:39.270 --> 08:41.268
It's hard to use magic, isn't it?

08:42.267 --> 08:47.262
(Panting)

08:47.262 --> 08:50.259
(Gasping)

08:50.259 --> 08:52.257
Dear god,

08:52.257 --> 08:55.254
let the heart of those who are bewildered

08:55.254 --> 08:57.252
be united with me!

08:57.252 --> 09:07.242
What did I do?

09:09.240 --> 09:11.238
I'm sorry.

09:11.238 --> 09:13.236
You did it, Kuroki!

09:13.236 --> 09:15.234
Alicia!

09:18.710 --> 09:18.830
Shura Iron

09:18.830 --> 09:19.969
Shura Iron

09:19.969 --> 09:24.125
My technique!

09:24.125 --> 09:33.495
Alicia, are you okay?

09:33.495 --> 09:34.175
Huh?

09:34.175 --> 09:35.713
Me?

09:35.713 --> 09:37.871
Uncle, what's this?

09:37.871 --> 09:39.849
With the magic

09:39.849 --> 09:49.839
that was strengthened with the wand, Alicia was able to use the techniques of her comrades.

09:50.838 --> 09:51.837
Really?

09:51.837 --> 09:53.835
She's really become a hero.

09:53.835 --> 10:00.209
Wait!

10:01.208 --> 10:02.207
Shura Iron

10:02.207 --> 10:12.197
Damn, a

10:24.105 --> 10:34.095
little bit of magic, huh?

10:34.095 --> 10:36.093
I'm finally here.

10:36.093 --> 10:39.090
Raidoka Nivaldo Baglhild.

10:39.090 --> 10:49.080
The spirits of the water here are really angry.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.078
Prepare yourself.

10:53.076 --> 11:02.067
Baglhild

11:02.067 --> 11:03.066
Baglhild

11:03.066 --> 11:04.065
Baglhild

11:04.065 --> 11:14.055
Alright.

11:23.046 --> 11:29.040
Thank you very much.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.037
As expected of the hero.

11:32.037 --> 11:34.035
I'll come back.

11:34.035 --> 11:41.028
Uncle, I'm sorry for being scared earlier.

11:41.028 --> 11:45.024
No, it's really nothing.

11:45.024 --> 11:48.021
For the time being, the barrier is blocked by the outer wall.

11:48.021 --> 11:50.019
Please check the bath.

11:50.019 --> 11:57.012
It's so free.

11:57.012 --> 12:01.008
You can go to the river while watching the sunrise.

12:01.008 --> 12:03.006
It's a big one.

12:03.006 --> 12:07.002
It's a great barrier.

12:07.002 --> 12:09.000
I can't believe I was able to use this kind of magic.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.997
I've put a big one on before.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.995
I'm glad it was useful.

12:13.995 --> 12:15.993
Yay!

12:15.993 --> 12:25.983
We can finally sell it to a barren inn with no

12:21.987 --> 12:24.984
Is that what you thought?

12:24.984 --> 12:27.981
It's exactly what Fevia said.

12:27.621 --> 12:27.981
What are you talking about, Rinea?

12:27.981 --> 12:31.977
Well, that's why the fight is over here.

12:31.977 --> 12:34.974
I'm glad you're happy with the result.

12:34.974 --> 12:39.969
But this is a story about being angry at me for not erasing my memory, right?

12:39.969 --> 12:42.966
Oh, that's right.

12:42.966 --> 12:47.961
After the battle, I went back to the hot spring.

12:47.961 --> 12:49.959
Send it quickly.

12:49.959 --> 12:50.958
Oh, yeah.

12:50.958 --> 12:53.955
Excuse me.

12:56.952 --> 12:59.949
I'm so tired of my voice.

12:59.949 --> 13:03.945
I'm so tired of being burned by a demon that I can't tell a man from a woman.

13:03.945 --> 13:05.943
Well, I'll send it quickly.

13:05.943 --> 13:06.942
As it is!

13:06.942 --> 13:16.932
Kuroki, I'm wearing my clothes.

13:16.932 --> 13:22.926
What?

13:24.924 --> 13:27.921
Did you think I was naked?

13:27.921 --> 13:30.918
Well, it's a hot spring.

13:30.918 --> 13:31.917
That's...

13:31.917 --> 13:35.913
That's not true.

13:35.913 --> 13:37.911
Don't go!

13:37.911 --> 13:38.910
Yes, sir!

13:38.910 --> 13:40.908
Sir?

13:40.908 --> 13:41.907
No, no.

13:41.907 --> 13:44.904
This isn't because I saw something sexy.

13:44.904 --> 13:45.903
I know.

13:45.903 --> 13:47.901
You've got your memory back, haven't you?

13:47.901 --> 13:50.898
There's no one who would look at something sexy and talk about it.

13:52.896 --> 13:55.893
Thank you. I was careless.

13:55.893 --> 13:59.889
I erased the memories of seeing Alicia naked.

13:59.889 --> 14:04.884
You're so mean.

14:04.884 --> 14:08.880
Oh.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.877
I know.

14:11.877 --> 14:15.873
You're not interested in a little girl like me, are you?

14:15.873 --> 14:17.871
Is that so?

14:17.871 --> 14:19.869
I'm 20 years old.

14:19.869 --> 14:20.868
That's right.

14:22.866 --> 14:23.865
We're the same age?

14:23.865 --> 14:25.863
Aren't you in your 30s?

14:25.863 --> 14:28.860
I'm in my 20s. I just turned 20.

14:28.860 --> 14:31.857
What month were you born?

14:31.857 --> 14:33.855
I was born in August.

14:33.855 --> 14:35.853
November.

14:35.853 --> 14:41.847
I'm... underage.

14:41.847 --> 14:45.843
Alicia is older.

14:45.843 --> 14:46.842
I agree.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.840
I can't see it.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.836
But this birthday might be wrong.

14:52.836 --> 14:54.834
What do you mean?

14:54.834 --> 15:00.828
I don't have any memories before I was nine.

15:00.828 --> 15:06.822
Kuroki, can you show me a spell to show my memory?

15:06.822 --> 15:08.820
It was August 11 years ago.

15:08.820 --> 15:09.819
Sure.

15:09.819 --> 15:11.817
Ikyuras Erlan.

15:15.813 --> 15:19.809
My first memory was of the blood and the horse carriage.

15:19.809 --> 15:24.804
I was taken out by the goblins in the carriage.

15:24.804 --> 15:29.799
I was saved by the police from the village where Liga and Edgar lived.

15:29.799 --> 15:35.793
I couldn't remember anything else after I was hit in the head.

15:35.793 --> 15:38.790
This was all I had.

15:38.790 --> 15:42.786
In the end, I couldn't find my family.

15:42.786 --> 15:46.782
I think I was killed by the goblins.

15:46.782 --> 15:56.772
After that, I was named Alicia by the Idyllian

16:05.763 --> 16:08.760
Alicia, do you remember things?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.758
Of course.

16:10.758 --> 16:14.754
You have no memories of the past, so everything you've experienced is a treasure.

16:11.737 --> 16:14.754
Well, that's why August isn't my birthday.

16:14.754 --> 16:17.751
I erased your memory twice.

16:17.751 --> 16:21.747
What? What are you kidding?

16:21.747 --> 16:26.742
I can use the Ikyuras Kiora memory erasing spell.

16:26.742 --> 16:30.738
Memory erasing...

16:38.730 --> 16:41.727
Why? I...

16:41.727 --> 16:48.720
Kuroky, what kind of memory did you erase?

16:48.720 --> 16:51.717
You'll get nosebleeds. Be careful.

16:51.717 --> 16:52.716
Nosebleeds?

16:52.716 --> 16:58.710
The first time I erased it was when I defeated the goblin army with Mr. Dold.

16:58.710 --> 17:04.704
The second time was when I captured the Shinnan Labyrinth from the back door.

17:07.701 --> 17:13.695
Then, the goblin punishment, the crusaders, and the hero's title...

17:13.695 --> 17:15.693
It's not me, it's Kuroky!

17:15.693 --> 17:17.691
I'm not that great.

17:17.691 --> 17:21.687
But you fixed the barrier of the sealed city without telling anyone!

17:21.687 --> 17:25.683
That's the way the legendary hero does it.

17:25.683 --> 17:27.681
So you were watching.

17:27.681 --> 17:30.678
You can reveal the truth. I'm going to run away.

17:30.678 --> 17:33.675
What do you mean? Why?

17:33.675 --> 17:36.672
I'm the one who broke the barrier.

17:37.671 --> 17:38.670
What?

17:38.670 --> 17:44.664
Why would you do that?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.662
I was just wondering if I could.

17:46.662 --> 17:53.655
You don't play with the lives of the people half-played, do you?

17:53.655 --> 17:58.650
I came from a different world.

17:58.650 --> 18:03.645
I'm a Japanese Bahamal, just like Mr. Murayama, who made the Purgatory.

18:03.645 --> 18:05.643
What? You?

18:05.643 --> 18:07.641
My goal is the Purgatory.

18:07.641 --> 18:13.635
So I thought that the strongest attack magic would be used on the strong barrier,

18:13.635 --> 18:18.630
and the distortion of the space-time would be the foothold of the Purgatory.

18:18.630 --> 18:22.626
As a result, the barrier was just broken.

18:22.626 --> 18:24.624
Um...

18:24.624 --> 18:30.618
Like the hypnotism today, you tried to make a hole in this and that wall?

18:30.618 --> 18:32.616
To put it simply, that's what it is.

18:33.615 --> 18:37.611
Is it over with the two times I said earlier that you erased my memories?

18:37.611 --> 18:39.609
Yeah, that's all.

18:39.609 --> 18:43.605
Don't use that kind of magic anymore!

18:43.605 --> 18:44.604
Not on me, not on anyone!

18:44.604 --> 18:47.601
It's for my life. If necessary, I'll erase it from now on.

18:47.601 --> 18:49.599
Kuroki!

18:49.599 --> 18:54.594
I don't want to forget about you!

18:54.594 --> 18:58.590
I don't want you to forget about me either!

18:58.590 --> 19:00.588
...

19:00.588 --> 19:10.578
I understand.

19:10.578 --> 19:14.574
I won't use the Purgatory magic on Alicia anymore.

19:14.574 --> 19:16.572
That's not enough!

19:16.572 --> 19:20.568
I won't erase my memories of Alicia either.

19:20.568 --> 19:21.567
How about this?

19:21.567 --> 19:26.562
Promise. Okay?

19:26.562 --> 19:27.561
Yeah.

19:29.559 --> 19:30.558
Okay.

19:30.558 --> 19:33.555
I'll use that to hit you.

19:33.555 --> 19:35.553
Ah, but...

19:35.553 --> 19:37.551
What is it this time?

19:37.551 --> 19:40.548
I see. I was reciting while taking notes earlier.

19:40.548 --> 19:43.545
Again? Did I erase some memories earlier?

19:43.545 --> 19:44.544
What kind of memories?

19:44.544 --> 19:46.542
No, it's just that my skin...

19:46.542 --> 19:48.540
I remember! Reproduce it.

19:48.540 --> 19:51.537
It's not a big deal, so it's fine!

19:51.537 --> 19:53.535
No! I promised.

19:53.535 --> 19:55.533
I won't erase my memories of Alicia.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.531
I just saw it for a bit!

19:57.531 --> 19:59.529
You saw it? What did you see?

19:59.529 --> 20:01.527
Um, then...

20:01.527 --> 20:03.525
Can you close your eyes?

20:03.525 --> 20:05.523
Oh, yeah.

20:05.523 --> 20:07.521
...

20:07.521 --> 20:17.511
No way...

20:28.500 --> 20:30.498
I can't get through this...

20:32.496 --> 20:33.495
No!

20:33.495 --> 20:37.491
No!

20:37.491 --> 20:47.481
I'm getting old...

20:48.480 --> 20:54.474
My friend, the demons attack, Alicia gets angry, and the elves shoot.

20:54.474 --> 20:54.833
It wasn't a purgatory, but a hellish

20:54.833 --> 20:57.471
It was a mess.

20:58.470 --> 21:01.467
What should I call you from now on?

21:01.467 --> 21:02.466
Kurokikon?

21:02.466 --> 21:05.463
No, I guess it's fine as it is now.

21:05.463 --> 21:11.457
You erased too many memories, and your head is going crazy, right?

21:11.457 --> 21:12.456
Yeah...

21:12.456 --> 21:15.453
Hey, mister, you should try to keep your memories simple.

21:15.453 --> 21:16.452
That's right!

21:16.452 --> 21:19.449
I erased some bad memories in the bathroom earlier, right?

21:19.449 --> 21:21.447
Huh? I didn't erase any.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.446
But...

21:22.446 --> 21:25.443
You look strangely refreshed.

21:25.443 --> 21:28.440
Oh, no, no. That's not magic.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.438
It's a technique to kill sensitivity.

21:30.438 --> 21:35.433
What is it?

21:35.433 --> 21:41.427
In theory, if you don't feel anything bad in your heart, you won't get any damage, right?

21:41.427 --> 21:42.426
That's what you do.

21:42.426 --> 21:46.422
It's a technique to kill before your heart is killed.

21:46.422 --> 21:49.419
When you're in your mid-20s, your use rate will go up.

21:49.419 --> 21:51.417
You two should practice from now on.

21:51.417 --> 21:53.415
I'm not doing it!

21:53.415 --> 21:54.414
Right, Takafu?

21:54.414 --> 21:56.412
If you don't have a heart...

21:56.412 --> 21:58.410
Yoshi.

21:58.410 --> 22:00.408
Okay, fine.

22:00.408 --> 22:01.407
Stop it!

22:01.407 --> 22:06.402
In the 20 years of the Heisei era, there were many things that happened.

22:06.402 --> 22:08.400
You're useful, mister.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.398
Takafumi! Hey, leave it alone!

22:10.398 --> 22:16.392
From now on, no matter what happens, if I have this technique, I feel like I can overcome
it.

22:18.390 --> 22:22.386
The End
