WEBVTT

00:13.897 --> 00:00:15.395
It's a hypno-beast!

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.210
It got Lenia to open the door!

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.022
Take care of her, Raiga

00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.697
On it!

00:00:22.787 --> 00:23.886
Edgar, fend off the beast!

00:23.886 --> 00:24.885
Roger!

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:31.782
Reylo Kasradoseld!

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:40.674
Those are Anti-Magic birds!

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.633
If we don't defeat them

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.469
we won't be able to use Kuroki's magic

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:44.965
If the birds get a foothold, it's over!

00:00:44.965 --> 00:45.864
Any ideas?

00:00:47.064 --> 00:47.862
Leave it to me!

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:51.059
What?

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.379
That's dangerous, Uncle!

00:00:53.479 --> 00:54.855
That's right.

00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.940
Without my magic,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.601
I have to rely on my two or three in physical-stats,

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:01.848
Which aren't of much use

00:01:03.898 --> 00:01:05.897
two or three, out of what?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.778
Uh, two is one, and one is none

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.738
He, so familiar, so different

00:01:12.356 --> 00:01:12.948
Yeah,

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.285
So different to when he's backing us up

00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:18.870
This is scary

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.590
but he became stronger by yearning for that strength

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.665
This is...

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:25.794
It's about you, Uncle!

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:28.297
They actually respect you so much!

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.263
Me?! Really? ME?

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:32.968
His strength is real.

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:37.213
What's with that? you guys...

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:38.765
Gigant Hunter,

00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:40.600
Doldore Lexudor!

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:48.702
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:50.600
I was wrong.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.262
I'm sorry, Uncle.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.191
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.987
You two can keep watching.

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:08.462
And I can't lose to Kuroki.

00:02:09.488 --> 00:02:12.049
Yeah, Kuroki is amazing, too.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.634
He's a weird guy.

02:14.775 --> 00:02:16.069
Hey, Uncle!

00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:18.160
Uncle! please...

00:02:18.247 --> 00:02:20.349
That's enough!

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.568
Just go and keep watching!

00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:23.602
Uncle!

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.646
I'm sorry, Uncle.

04:10.858 --> 00:04:12.337
He's not coming out.

00:04:12.337 --> 04:14.275
Will he be okay?

04:14.275 --> 04:16.932
I believe in his strength.

04:16.932 --> 04:18.930
He'll get better.

04:18.930 --> 04:20.349
You're right.

04:20.349 --> 04:23.226
So let's wait for him while we keep watching.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.140
Okay?

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.058
Hurry! Let's continue!

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:27.851
You...

00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:38.778
Um...

04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.782
The correct order was... wind, fire, then ice

00:04:55.453 --> 00:04:56.205
Uncle!

00:04:56.405 --> 04:57.352
He's alive!

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.613
- Uncle! - That must hurt!

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:18.091
Safe

00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:20.600
But what was that attack?

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:21.571
Elf did it

00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:23.306
Uncle!

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:24.783
Are you okay now?

05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.535
Yeah, of course.

05:26.563 --> 00:05:29.037
That Elf's new equipment.

00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:31.356
The "scabbard" she went out to get it in a hurry.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:33.024
What? Scabbard?

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.171
It's a super-weapon

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.007
completely operational

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.346
Glasses! A Ponytail!

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.390
The scabbard is fine, but what's with the glasses?

00:05:48.523 --> 00:05:50.308
That's an ancient magic tool too.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.063
Ork, I'm not that way!

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.431
THIS way!

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:57.599
Idiot!

00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:01.653
This way!

00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:03.321
He ran away!

06:03.427 --> 00:06:07.868
Elven Royalty hunt humans that way,
to satisfy their dark cravings.

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.330
-Oh, there's a bird over there
-This is all the Elf's fault.

00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:13.757
Oh, right, what's up with those birds that can seal away magic?

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.336
I learnt later that they have

06:18.412 --> 00:06:24.175
A "demonic breath" that can suppress the spirit's activity.

06:24.406 --> 00:06:26.304
There's a logical explanation!

00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:28.388
It sounds like fantasy worldbuilding.

06:28.402 --> 00:06:33.340
No, it's more like: "That bird stinks, I don't want to work!"

06:33.347 --> 00:06:34.477
That's what it sounds like.

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.229
Oh, I see.

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:37.814
"Demonic Breath"

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.817
Legs, Wid, Zaldona!

00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:48.116
It still stinks, so it still doesn't work.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.702
How demonic is that "demonic breath"?

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.038
Spirits are so finicky though.

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:57.818
Well, that's how we got back to Alicia and the others.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.628
No!

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:05.500
They're being controlled!

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.081
Alicia!

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.441
Kuroki!

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:22.984
Oh, a burn!

00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:25.145
God, give me a light to heal!

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:24.277
Thanks!

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.218
Can't you get rid of their hypnosis with that wand?

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.286
No way!

07:33.337 --> 00:07:34.871
I need to get close and do it one by one.

00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:38.041
Besides, the essence of the God's power is to heal the mind and body.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:40.960
It's powerless against any and all violence.

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:41.878
It's over!

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.172
Is there a switch that you can activate?

00:07:44.272 --> 00:07:46.591
Elf sword has a switch that can activate a special function.

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.439
A switch?

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.095
Maybe... twisting it?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.938
Huh?

08:06.001 --> 00:08:08.763
Kuroki, what are you doing?

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:12.075
Seems like... that light isn't harmful.

00:08:12.175 --> 00:08:14.577
No... I mean yes, it's not.

08:14.595 --> 00:08:17.592
Is this light the effect of the wand?

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.875
Alicia, try to get rid of the hypnosis now.

08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.377
Oh, I got it.

08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.870
But...

00:08:24.654 --> 00:08:25.931
Hypnotization Magic is tricky,

00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:30.102
Since it synchronizes mind with the mind of the other person,
I first need to calm down a bit,

00:08:30.118 --> 00:08:31.378
Or there may be some misunderstandings...

00:08:31.478 --> 08:32.277
What?

08:32.377 --> 00:08:34.055
I can't hear you.

08:34.176 --> 00:08:37.979
I'm sorry, but please don't look at me.

00:08:38.072 --> 08:39.270
Oh, sorry.

08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.563
Magic is hard, isn't it?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.490
Dear God,

00:08:53.750 --> 08:56.254
Let the heart of those who are bewildered

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.096
Be united with me!

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.040
What did I do?

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.636
I'm sorry.

09:11.638 --> 00:09:13.578
It worked, Kuroki!

00:09:15.386 --> 00:09:16.097
Alicia!

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.685
Armour Buster Rampage

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:24.731
My technique!

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.115
Alicia, are you okay?

09:34.175 --> 00:09:36.013
Huh? Me?

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:38.661
Uncle, what happened?

00:09:38.790 --> 09:41.449
Her magic got strengthened by using the wand,

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:45.135
Alicia was able to use the techniques of her comrades.

00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:49.589
And the move had increased potency due to having

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.349
the power of god or whatever behind it

00:09:51.449 --> 00:09:52.237
Really?

00:09:52.237 --> 09:54.135
She's really become a hero.

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:00.509
Wait!

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.195
Crap, there's too many

00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:23.340
When they come in a straight line, they get caught easily.

10:28.095 --> 00:10:29.754
Finally.

10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.007
Raidoka Nivaldo Baglhild.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.001
The spirits of the water here...

00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:42.684
are really angry.

10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.978
Prepare yourselves.

00:11:02.954 --> 11:04.266
Baglhild

00:11:22.604 --> 11:23.855
Alright.

00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:30.023
Thank you very much.

11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.525
As expected of the hero.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.736
We need to train more.

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:41.451
Old man, I'm sorry for being scared  of
you earlier.

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:46.124
No, it's really nothing.

00:11:46.124 --> 00:11:48.791
For the time being, I placed a barrier where the hole in the outer wall was.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.668
Please, check the baths.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.675
It feels so liberating.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:02.030
Now we can go to the river to watch the sunrise!

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:03.932
This is awesome.

12:06.106 --> 00:12:07.644
It's such an amazing barrier.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.355
I can't believe you are able to use this kind of magic.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.997
I once built a big one.

00:12:12.997 --> 00:12:14.943
I'm glad it was useful.

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:20.365
Instead of a boring inn with nothing to do, we can finally offer something unique!

00:12:20.687 --> 00:12:22.200
Is that how you viewed the inn?

00:12:24.584 --> 00:12:26.204
But it's exactly like she said.

12:27.621 --> 00:12:29.591
Why keep lying about it?

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:33.005
Well, we managed to get everything under control.

00:12:33.077 --> 00:12:35.838
I'm glad you're happy with the result.

00:12:36.874 --> 00:12:41.427
But wasn't this story about someone getting angry at you for erasing memories?

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:44.064
Oh, that's right.

00:12:44.424 --> 00:12:49.419
After the battle, I went back to the hot spring.

00:12:49.619 --> 00:12:50.853
Fast forward it quickly.

00:12:53.316 --> 00:12:55.008
Excuse me.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.947
I missed my chance to say I was already here.

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:05.303
The wall between men's and women's baths got burned down during the monster's attack.

00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:07.001
Well, I'll fast forward it quickly.

00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:07.829
Don't you dare!

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:18.089
Kuroki, I'm wearing my clothes.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:23.344
What?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.182
Did you think I was naked?

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:33.062
Well, it's a hot spring.

00:13:34.275 --> 00:13:36.816
I could never do that

00:13:38.375 --> 00:13:39.216
Iculus Cuora

00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:40.094
So quick!

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.354
Uncle!

00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:43.848
No, no.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.059
This isn't because I saw something sexy.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:46.909
I know.

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:48.494
You've got your memory back, haven't you?

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:52.165
But even then, it's perfectly normal to look at someone sexy and get happy about it.

00:13:54.054 --> 00:13:56.294
Thank you. I was careless.

00:13:56.751 --> 00:14:01.074
I erased my memories of seeing Alicia naked.

00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:06.471
Sorry you had to see that.

00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:13.202
I knew it.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.607
You're not interested in a little girl like me, are you?

00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:18.629
Is that so?

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:20.526
I'm twenty years old.

00:14:21.127 --> 00:14:22.145
That's right...

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:25.224
We're the same age?

00:14:25.224 --> 00:14:27.221
Aren't you in your thirties?

00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:29.827
I'm in my twenties. I just turned twenty.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.039
What month were you born?

00:14:33.074 --> 00:14:35.041
I was born in August.

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.709
November.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:43.216
He's... younger.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.470
Alicia is older.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.806
I agree.  I can't see it.

00:14:50.298 --> 00:14:54.018
But my birthday date might be wrong.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.686
What do you mean?

00:14:57.892 --> 00:15:02.276
I don't have any memories before I was nine.

00:15:03.886 --> 00:15:07.824
Kuroki, can you show me a spell to show my memory?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.278
It was August eleven years ago.

00:15:10.378 --> 00:15:11.377
Sure.

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:13.037
Iculus Erlan.

00:15:17.071 --> 00:15:21.367
My first memory was of the blood and the horse carriage.

00:15:22.967 --> 00:15:26.100
I was taken out by the goblins in the carriage.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.847
I was saved by the guards from the village where Raiga and Edgar lived.

00:15:31.457 --> 00:15:36.936
I couldn't remember anything else after I was hit in the head.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.648
This was all I had.

00:15:41.348 --> 00:15:44.277
In the end, I couldn't find my family.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:48.239
I suspect they were killed by the goblins.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.245
After that, I was named Alicia by the Idyllian

00:15:54.345 --> 00:15:56.414
Because I have no memories of the past,

00:15:56.514 --> 00:15:59.542
I treasure all the new ones I’ve made.

00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:10.136
Alicia, are memories that important to you?

00:16:10.518 --> 00:16:12.814
Of course.

00:16:13.095 --> 00:16:16.312
Well, that's the story of why August may not be my
birthday after all.

00:16:16.312 --> 00:16:19.687
I erased your memory twice.

00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:23.032
What? Are you kidding?

00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:27.737
I can use "Iculus Cuora", a memory erasing spell.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.658
Memory erasing...

00:16:40.188 --> 00:16:43.711
Why? I...

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:50.510
Kuroki, what kind of memory did you erase?

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.637
You'll get nosebleeds. Be warned.

00:16:52.975 --> 00:16:53.638
Nosebleeds?

00:16:54.574 --> 00:16:56.349
The first time I erased it,

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.727
was when I defeated the goblin army on
the path on Dord Mountain.

00:17:01.068 --> 00:17:02.313
The second time

00:17:02.413 --> 00:17:05.983
was when we cleared the Shinnan
Labyrinth using a backdoor.

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:15.034
Then, the goblin punishment, the crusaders, and the hero's title...

00:17:15.153 --> 00:17:17.428
They are not mine, they are yours, Kuroki's!

00:17:17.551 --> 00:17:19.549
I'm not that great.

00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:23.334
But you fixed the barrier of the sealed city without telling anyone!

00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:27.541
That's the way the legendary hero does it.

00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:29.539
So you were watching.

00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:32.536
You can reveal the truth. I'll just
escape to somewhere far away.

00:17:32.536 --> 00:17:35.533
What do you mean? Why?

00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:38.530
I'm the one who broke the barrier.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.428
What?

00:17:44.728 --> 00:17:46.875
Why would you do that?

00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:48.973
I was just wondering if I could.

00:17:48.973 --> 00:17:55.616
You don't play with the lives of the people, do you?

00:17:57.566 --> 00:18:00.663
I came from a different world.

00:18:00.763 --> 00:18:06.143
I'm a Japanese Bahamal, just like Mr. Murayama, who made the Purgatory.

00:18:06.243 --> 00:18:07.156
What? You?

00:18:07.156 --> 00:18:09.297
My goal is to find a way back.

00:18:11.254 --> 00:18:14.885
So I thought: If I hit the strongest barrier with the strongest attack magic

00:18:15.148 --> 00:18:20.224
the distortion of the space-time may allow me to return.

00:18:20.643 --> 00:18:24.562
Instead, the barrier was broken.

00:18:25.339 --> 00:18:26.437
Um...

00:18:26.437 --> 00:18:32.069
Like the hypno-beast today, you tried to make a hole in that wall between worlds?

00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:34.155
To put it simply, that's how it was.

00:18:35.055 --> 00:18:39.051
Is it over? Only those two times?

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:40.628
Yeah, that's all.

00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:44.915
Don't use that kind of magic anymore!

00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:46.214
Not on me, or anyone else!

00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:49.411
It's to survive. If necessary, I'll keep erasing...

00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:50.338
Kuroki!

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:55.936
I don't want to forget about you!

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:59.555
I don't want you to forget about me either!

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:12.234
I understand.

00:19:12.988 --> 00:19:16.030
I won't use memory-erasing magic on Alicia anymore.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:17.948
That's not enough!

00:19:18.882 --> 00:19:21.978
I won't erase my memories of Alicia either.

00:19:21.978 --> 00:19:22.679
How about this?

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.625
Promise. Okay?

00:19:27.725 --> 00:19:28.724
Yeah.

00:19:31.222 --> 00:19:32.221
Okay.

00:19:33.122 --> 00:19:35.174
We have an agreement.

00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:37.385
Ah, but...

00:19:37.416 --> 00:19:38.911
What is it this time?

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:42.206
I see. So that's why you were casting while taking notes earlier...

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:45.408
Again? Did I erase some memories earlier?

00:19:45.408 --> 00:19:46.107
What kind of memories?

00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:48.305
No, it's just that you saw me nake...

00:19:48.305 --> 00:19:49.839
I'll try to recall it! Reproduce it.

00:19:51.199 --> 00:19:53.200
It's not a big deal, it's fine!

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.198
No! I made a promise.

00:19:55.298 --> 00:19:57.396
That I wouldn't erase my memories of Alicia.

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:59.094
You just saw it for a bit!

00:19:59.094 --> 00:20:00.558
I saw it? What did I see?

00:20:01.392 --> 00:20:03.390
Um, then...

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.522
Can you close your eyes?

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.056
Oh, yeah.

00:20:28.184 --> 00:20:29.770
No way...

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.772
She can break through this barrier?

00:20:48.255 --> 00:20:50.050
He's younger...

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.293
And that's how it went:

00:20:52.393 --> 00:20:55.921
the demons attacked, Alicia got angry, Elf sniped me (repeatedly)

00:20:56.003 --> 00:20:58.299
It wasn't a "purgatory", it was hellish.

00:20:58.399 --> 00:20:59.740
"The Hot Springs of Hell"

00:21:01.035 --> 00:21:02.637
What should I call you from now on?

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:03.536
Kuroki-kun?

00:21:03.636 --> 00:21:06.633
No, I guess it's fine as it is now.

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:10.853
Your Uncle erased so many memories,

00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:12.855
that his head is going crazy, right?

00:21:12.927 --> 00:21:13.626
Yeah...

00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:17.485
Hey, Uncle, you should take it easy with the memory erasure

00:21:17.543 --> 00:21:18.527
That's right!

00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:21.447
You erased some bad memories in the bathroom earlier, right?

00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:22.817
Huh? I didn't erase any.

00:21:22.817 --> 00:21:23.616
But...

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.613
You look strangely refreshed.

00:21:26.813 --> 00:21:29.810
Oh, no, no. That's not magic.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.708
It's a technique to kill sensitivity.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.103
What did you say?

00:21:37.103 --> 00:21:40.132
Theoretically, even if you experience something terrible,

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:41.759
if you don't feel anything in your heart,

00:21:41.859 --> 00:21:42.844
there's no damage, right?

00:21:42.944 --> 00:21:44.096
That's what I did.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:47.292
It's a technique to kill your heart,
before your heart is damaged.

00:21:47.892 --> 00:21:50.851
Once you're in your middle age, your use
rate will go way up.

00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:53.087
You two should practice it while you
have a chance.

00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:54.585
I'm not doing it!

00:21:54.585 --> 00:21:56.584
-Right, Takafumi? -I see

00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:57.582
As long as you don’t feel anything...

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.280
Good.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.978
Yeah, this is fine.

00:22:01.978 --> 00:22:02.977
Stop it!

00:22:03.077 --> 00:22:06.492
In the twenty years of the Heisei era,

00:22:06.592 --> 00:22:08.872
there were many things that happened.

00:22:08.872 --> 00:22:10.170
This is so useful, Uncle.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.768
Takafumi! Hey, stop it already!

00:22:11.768 --> 00:22:13.999
From now on, no matter what happens,

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:15.826
if I have this technique,

00:22:15.926 --> 00:22:18.362
I feel like I can overcome it.
