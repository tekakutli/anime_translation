NOTE by Tekakutli

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.000
This is where that suspicious man lives...

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.000
I have to protect Fujimi!

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.900
Um... Takaoka Takaoka...

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.340
So hard... no doorplate

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.940
Hello there!

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.060
You came to play too?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.000
No, no...

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.680
What are you doing?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.340
- Ah! please save me... - Brother Takafumi!

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.340
- Hey, you're here

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.500
...Hmmm?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.700
Then, let's go to your room.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.700
I caught a really cute one the other day.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.300
I took a video and uploaded it to the internet.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.100
Oh, a cute one indeed!

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.700
Is your collection complete now?

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.900
Of course not!!!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I think it's just about time for the next one.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Fujimi...

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.360
Excuse me!

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.880
Oh, welcome!

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.080
Huh? Why is Sawa here?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.960
Run! I'll buy you time, hurry up and run!

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.340
What are you talking about?

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.300
These guys are scumbags

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.260
who think of women as "collectables"!

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.900
I've only seen people like that in comic books!

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.220
Sawa, you're reading something awful.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.940
Is your uncle home?

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.440
He's out for a bit.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.780
Huh?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.280
Fish?

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.640
It's an Obon Offering,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.240
normally, it's eggplant or cucumber.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.440
Hey, I hope uncle doesn't fly back!

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.120
Don't worry. I just raised a flag,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.000
it's a spirit sign.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.920
A flag? A spirit?

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.200
But if anyone finds out about his secret,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.800
he can use Iculus Cuora.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.000
I know!

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.820
but if he uses Iculus Cuora,
it can affect their personality!

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.860
We're running away, Fujimi!

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.860
Huh?

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.660
Sawa?

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780
This cult is definitely dangerous!

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.780
W-W-Wait!

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.420
Uncle!

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.340
Huh?

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.140
Huh?

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.300
I-I'm sorry, but don't turn
Fujimiya into a cultist, please!

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.120
A cultist?

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.560
You're exaggerating.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.120
Did you see it on the internet?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.700
It's all lies.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.620
It's safe.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.080
That's not how SEGA works.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.460
Geez!

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.800
That talk... it's just like one of those pyramid schemes.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.900
YouTuber?

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.500
I see. I thought you were in a cult.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.180
What's that?

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.260
Takafumi's uncle is strange, but he's a good person.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.020
But why is Fujimi here?

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.260
Well, that's...

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.900
Hey, Chippu-peppa!

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.220
It's me, ojisan-man!

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.820
It's definitely popular. You can use it.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.740
Oh, ojisan-man sounds great,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.980
but if a 35-year-old man does it...

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.100
I see.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.900
-Fujimi. -Huh?

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.440
I want some coffee.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.100
I'll go get it.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.580
So, she's after Takafumi.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.700
Then I have to check.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.700
-Takafumi-kun. -Huh?

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.000
Hey, wanna see a picture of me and Fujimi on a trip?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.220
Okay, I got it.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.300
Hey, it's close!

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.460
Let's sit down. Let's sit down for now.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.620
What do you think?

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.140
If you're just staring at her chest,
then you are a scumbag.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.420
This guy has no shame!

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.140
Who's this guy?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.500
I don't know.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.660
A clerk?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.300
Oh, I see.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.740
Then what about this picture?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.420
Why me?

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.660
Who's this guy?

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.060
What? Am I invisible?

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.540
Hmm...

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.460
Takafumi, you were in elementary school?

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.100
What was Fujimi like in the past?

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.420
She was a bit cooler.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.860
Well, she hasn't changed much.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.820
I see.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.820
She looked like the current Chiaki.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.580
Oh, that cute little brother?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.020
We haven't seen each other for over two years.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.020
He's over there.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.220
So, are you ready to take THAT video?

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.940
It's okay. I won't upload it online.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.340
You're already taking it?

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340
Yeah.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.260
What are you doing, Fujimi?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.260
What?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.460
What are you doing, Fujimi?

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.940
Now I know,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.240
he's interested in women after all.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.820
That's my picture!

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.740
Takafumi?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.540
Sawa, you were talking about Fujimi childhood, right?

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.100
Did you meet her in high school?

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.660
Y-Yes.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.300
Iculus Elran.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.660
Fujimi from elementary school was...

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.540
Huh? This is...

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.540
What's going on?

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.620
Uncle! Uncle!

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.700
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.600
Oh.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.900
Spirit of memory,

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.300
fade away their memories...

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.700
Chiaki, run!

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.700
Huh?

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.220
Fuji, what was that?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.180
Huh? that... was a Sonny's console.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.220
Sonny didn't make that.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.980
They did! now, just leave.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.500
Ojisan...

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.500
Please stop erasing memories.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.780
Sorry.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.100
I remember being scolded for erasing memories

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.300
in the other world.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.100
Huh? When?

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.060
That was...

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.700
Oh, right. At the hot spring.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.940
A hot spring...

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.740
The one you went to with Elf

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.660
after you stopped being the Demon Dragon?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.380
Yeah.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.860
What? What are hot springs like in the other world?

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.940
Do we get fan-service?

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.340
I'll ask.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.620
Let's see...

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.220
It doesn't seem like that's the case.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.220
The spirit of memory optimizes the camera angle to suit the viewer.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.460
It seems that baths are considered to be private.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.300
That's so advanced...

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.220
How attentive.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.820
Iculus Elran.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.660
Huh?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.800
Elf?

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.500
Elfs are female, so there's no footage.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.180
That's a long bath.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.500
It's been a month, so it should be long.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.900
About 20 minutes left?

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.140
Hurry up!

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.220
Oh, 20 minutes...

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:41.780
A yukata?

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.420
Why?

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.300
Huh? Why?

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.500
Well, it's not a rewind...

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.380
A rewind!

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.980
Either way is fine, so hurry up!

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.100
What was that?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.560
Armor's removal is secret magical technique

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.040
of the Elgar royal family.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.260
Royal family, huh?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.280
What? Are you changing your attitude now?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.340
I like Garfie's Varga from Guardian Heroes

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.340
because the motion of Graviton Thunder and Zero Drive Illusion is super cool,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.300
not because he was royalty.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.940
You're you.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.140
Yeah.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.620
The hot spring's far away.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.940
We're almost there.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.840
We're here. This is it.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.140
Japanese?
A inn? Why?

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.360
You know the Japanese Bahamaru language?

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.120
As Mabel said, you really are a transfer.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.040
Japanese Bahamaru...

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.020
The person who built this inn was a transfer from 20 years ago's Japanese Bahamaru.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.220
What?!

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.320
There's another transfer besides the
ancestors of Mabel and uncle?

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.320
Is... he here?

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.720
Murayama, the person who was from Grand
Bahamaru, 20 years ago,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.320
stayed only for 10 days.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.520
Where did Murayama go?

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.820
He was 88 years old, he died.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.320
I see.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.020
"Purgatory waters"

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.820
You really can read it.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.820
What does purgatory mean?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.520
To put it simply

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.220
it's a world where you purify yourself

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.420
before you go to the world beyond death.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.120
In other words, he recognized this world as such.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.320
You knew about it, uncle!

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.820
Yeah, it's amazing!

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.420
Yeah, the 90s were full of difficult words.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.420
I learned purgatory from the "The Evil King's Prologue to Purgatory."

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.820
"The Evil King's Prologue to Purgatory"?

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.320
Hello, there.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.920
I'm Grandstone, the leader of the purgatory.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.320
You seem to know a lot about Sendai.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.420
Yeah, the transfer story is popular in the country, but...

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.420
It's a real shame that only one person, Shojiro, built this inn.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.420
Oh...

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.020
I've heard rumors that he brought the inn from Japan Bahamaru.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.420
That's not true.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.420
If a person from another world dies, what that person brought will disappear

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.820
When Sendai took his last breath,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.720
his clothes and body disappeared right in front of my eyes.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.620
Oh, the new truth!

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.420
It's the same as the record of the knights of the Toshin-ken.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:40.420
It is said that the transfer from another world can be given one power from God.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.420
That is, the ability to freely operate material from living things.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.520
And he used the power of the knights to build this inn.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.420
Uncle, are you organizing your inventory?

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.420
They're talking about something really important.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.620
In action games, there are times when you can't skip a long demo part.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.420
In the meantime, doing something else is engraved in your body.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420
That's why.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.420
...but this's the story of the game.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.420
...an important event to learn the mystery of the world.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.420
Ork, let's go.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.020
Are the three of you managing the hot springs, alone?

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.920
Our services won't disappoint you, Mr.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.720
I wonder if Mr. Murayama got treated like this.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:36.320
By the way, old man, you're a bit rough with older people in another world, right?

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.420
Oh, that's true. You're also polite to young shopkeepers.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520
It's something you return

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.520
only when you are recognized as a person by others.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.420
What an intimidating presence.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.420
Well, being polite got him sold for three coppers.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.420
A night at the inn will cost you 400,000 pieces for two people.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.620
400,000 pieces? Isn't this a scam?!

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.420
It's about 40,000 yen for a Japanese-yen coin.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.420
There are also high-priced coins.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.420
Oh, what?

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.420
Then, uncle's value when he got sold was...

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.420
30 cents.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.520
Cents?!!!

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.420
Not even a yen.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.520
So, here it is.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.420
It felt good to take a bath.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.420
End it soon!

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.420
That yukata looks nice on you.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.420
Right?

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.520
The knight's flag 400 years ago had a kikata on it.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.420
Oh, you even have a book about it.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.420
It's called kimono, right?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.320
But it feels a little breezy.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.520
Oh, it's there.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.420
I see. Then my room is...

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.420
Where are you going?
It's here too!

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.220
Why?

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.420
It's... it's the only one available.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.220
-Really? -Really

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320
But, it feels empty, other than us

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.420
The inn was designed to keep guests away from other guests.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.920
I don't like the idea, but it can't be helped.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.820
You don't like it?

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.120
There's only one other group of guests today,

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.920
so I'll... prepare another room...

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.420
Come on.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.320
Let's go in.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:26.820
The kid...

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.020
You don't take care of your public image anymore, Tsundere-san.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.120
The futon is on the floor.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.120
That's right!

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.420
Tatami.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.320
This is tatami, right?

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.520
It smells unique.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.420
Do you miss it?

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.920
No. My room had a floor and a bed, so not that much.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.420
Bye.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.320
What's with this space?

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.220
What is this space?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.320
It's a mystery space!

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.720
It's a mystery space!

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.420
I can't believe you're in the same room.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.420
I'll sleep here, so you can use it all.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.820
Bye.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.720
What?

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.220
I've been looking for him for a month.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.420
Stupid ork-face.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.720
Are you tired?

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.920
Hey!

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.420
Your legs are really tense.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.520
I was looking for you.
What are you doing?

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.220
A massage would help you with that, especially after a bath.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.620
I'm grateful to you.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.720
If it weren't for your warm heart,

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.220
I might not have been able to return
from being a dragon.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.920
Ouch!

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.420
What?

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.420
Ouch!

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.820
Don't run away.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.420
Pressure hurts because you're tense.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.420
It's my fault, so you have to loosen it.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.420
Ready...

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.320
It feels good! It feels good!

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.420
That's enough!

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.120
You idiot ork!

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:33.920
What are you doing?

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.420
I'm the one who's going to...

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.720
This is bad!

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.720
I'm scared!

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.620
It's heavy. Get off me.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.620
Ork-face?

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.420
W-What?

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.320
Stop!

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.520
Are you okay with going forward?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.520
Isn't this bad?

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.020
There's nothing bad about it.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.920
But...

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.320
Can you hear me...

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.420
Great Spirit of Memories?

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.420
Everyone is an adult here.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.020
Forget the censorship, it's okay to be rough.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.620
Tomorrow, we can pretend this never happened.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.820
I'm counting on you.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.420
Fujimiya...

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.620
I'm going to resume.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.020
Regsurd Stagga.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.920
Stagga Magnum.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.120
What are you guys doing?

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.420
Alicia...

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.820
Alicia wanted to peek.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.420
W-W-Wait! I just said I was curious.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.420
A hero's first move?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.920
The other group of guests were Alicia and the others?

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.420
Kuroki, I'm sorry.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.420
Kuroki, huh?

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.120
I'm sorry!

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.420
I was wondering what kind of relationship you two have.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.320
What kind of relationship do you think we have?

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.820
That's...

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.420
*WHISPERS*

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.420
Oh, I see.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.420
I'm in trouble.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.420
So easy.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.420
I'm glad. So easy.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.420
A hero?

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.420
You?

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.120
Here. This is for defeating the Hedgehog.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.420
I see.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.920
Check if it's enough.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.320
It's fine.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.420
No it isn't!

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.420
It's okay to trust others like that.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.420
But naive trust could...

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.020
You're the ones I trusted.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.420
Not others.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.020
For a moment you sounded so cool Edgar!

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.420
Shut up, Madness Berserker.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.420
Then you two are...

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.420
Hero, I won't tell you the details,

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.320
but this ring is a gift from that ork-face.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.020
Without context!

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.420
She took off the most important details intentionally!

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.420
You didn't get a ring from him, did you?

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.620
What?

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.920
O-Of course not!

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.420
There is no way Kuroki sees me that way.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.620
You two.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.420
Have you been escorting the hero for long?

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.120
Yeah, kind of.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.720
So, who do you think will win the hero's heart?

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.820
Elf-san!

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.520
I guess you'll have to decide with a duel.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.420
Wait! ...eh!

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.220
What?

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.420
No.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.420
I have the right to choose.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.420
I knew it, but you're so mean!

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.420
Are childhood friends that weak?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.420
So, what are you doing in the mountains?

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.420
We're training.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.220
The Shinan Labyrinth was a painful reminder that we need to get stronger.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.220
The Shinan Labyrinth?

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.420
Speaking of which, thank you so much for this!

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.420
The Wand of Salvation?!

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.520
But... the legend says that the color of the Wand is dark like the night.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.420
I painted it.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.420
Now looks cute.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.720
It's an ancient magic tool.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.820
It's lost its magic.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.120
That Moonlight Stone is nowhere to be found.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.420
I want you to understand how important this is.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.020
What were you training?

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:30.320
Huh?

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.620
It's a skill, of course.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.420
You guys fight with the power of the spirit and the gods, right?

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.620
We use our physical abilities to refine our skills.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.220
A special skill?

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.420
I want to see it.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.820
It's a pain in the ass.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.420
Please show me.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.420
What are you talking about?

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.620
Iculus Elran.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.420
Here comes Kuroki's weird magic.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.620
Wow, something's coming out.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.720
It's a fighting game.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.620
What are you looking at?

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.920
This scabbard!

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.420
Yeah, it was thrown away, so I used it as a laundry host.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.420
Even if it's just a sword scabbard.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.420
This is it!

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.020
Where is that place?

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.220
The top of the northern mountain.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.220
Huh? Are you going there right now?

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.420
It's pretty far.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.520
Hero.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.920
Don't let them get in your way.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.320
What?

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.620
Um, why did Elf left so suddenly?

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.820
She found an ancient magic tool.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.120
An ancient magic tool?

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.020
It's an ancient magic weapon.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.620
Elves value ancient culture, so they collect it.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.620
Hey, Kuroki, should we let her go alone?

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.420
Elf should be fine, I trust in her.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.620
Anyway, is this inn safe against monsters?

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.420
The owner of the inn said that it was built with the power of the gods.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.220
Unless you can imitate it...

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.320
It smells like something is burning.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.540
The End
